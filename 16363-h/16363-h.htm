      <h3 class="two">First Report from the Front</h3>

      <p class="right">7th September, 1914.</p>

      <p>MY LORD: I have the honor to report the proceedings of the field force
      under my command up to the time of rendering this dispatch.</p>

      <p>1. The transport of the troops from England both by sea and by rail
      was effected in the best order and without a check. Each unit arrived at
      its destination in this country well within the scheduled time.</p>

      <p>The concentration was practically complete on the evening of Friday,
      the 21st ultimo, and I was able to make dispositions to move the force
      during Saturday, the 22d, to positions I considered most favorable from
      which to commence operations which the French Commander in Chief, Gen.
      Joffre, requested me to undertake in pursuance of his plans in
      prosecution of the campaign.</p>

      <p>The line taken up extended along the line of the canal from
      Cond&eacute; on the west, through Mons and Binche on the east. This line
      was taken up as follows:</p>

      <p>From Cond&eacute; to Mons inclusive was assigned to the Second Corps,
      and to the right of the Second Corps from Mons the First Corps was
      posted. The Fifth Cavalry Brigade was placed at Binche.</p>

      <p>In the absence of my Third Army Corps I desired to keep the cavalry
      division as much as possible as a reserve to act on my outer flank, or
      move in support of any threatened part of the line. The forward
      reconnoissance was intrusted to Brig. Gen. Sir Philip Chetwode with the
      Fifth Cavalry Brigade, but I directed Gen. Allenby to send forward a few
      squadrons to assist in this work.</p>

      <p>During the 22d and 23d these advanced squadrons did some excellent
      work, some of them penetrating as far as Soignies, and several encounters
      took place in which our troops showed to great advantage.</p>

      <p>2. At 6 A.M., on Aug. 23, I assembled the commanders of the First and
      Second Corps and cavalry division at a point close to the position and
      explained the general situation of the Allies, and what I understood to
      be Gen. Joffre's plan. I discussed with them at some length the immediate
      situation in front of us.</p>

      <p>From information I received from French Headquarters I understood that
      little more than one, or at most two, of the enemy's army corps, with
      perhaps one cavalry division, were in front of my position; and I was
      aware of no attempted outflanking movement by the enemy. I was confirmed
      in this opinion by the fact that my patrols encountered no undue
      opposition in their reconnoitring operations. The observations of my
      aeroplanes seemed also to bear out this estimate.</p>

      <p>About 3 P.M. on Sunday, the 23d, reports began coming in to the effect
      that the enemy was commencing an attack on the Mons line, apparently in
      some strength, but that the right of the position from Mons and Bray was
      being particularly threatened.</p>

      <p>The commander of the First Corps had pushed his flank back to some
      high ground south of Bray, and the Fifth Cavalry Brigade evacuated
      Binche, moving slightly south; the enemy thereupon occupied Binche.</p>

      <p>The right of the Third Division, under Gen. Hamilton, was at Mons,
      which formed a somewhat dangerous salient; and I directed the commander
      of the Second Corps to be careful not to keep the troops on this salient
      too long, but, if threatened seriously, to draw back the centre behind
      Mons.  This was done before dark. In the meantime, about 5 P.M., I
      received a most unexpected message from Gen. Joffre by telegraph, telling
      me that at least three German corps, viz., a reserve corps, the Fourth
      Corps and the Ninth Corps, were moving on my position in front, and that
      the Second Corps was engaged in a turning movement from the direction of
      Tournay. He also informed me that the two reserve French divisions and
      the Fifth French Army on my right were retiring, the Germans having on
      the previous day gained possession of the passages of the Sambre between
      Charleroi and Namur.</p>

      <p>3. In view of the possibility of my being driven from the Mons
      position, I had
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'previouly']">previously</ins>
      ordered a position in rear to be reconnoitred. This position rested on
      the fortress of Maubeuge on the right and extended west to Jenlain,
      southeast of Valenciennes, on the left. The position was reported
      difficult to hold, because standing crops and buildings made the siting
      of trenches very difficult and limited the field of fire in many
      important localities. It nevertheless afforded a few good artillery
      positions.</p>

      <p>When the news of the retirement of the French and the heavy German
      threatening on my front reached me, I endeavored to confirm it by
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'areoplane']">aeroplane</ins>
      reconnoissance; and as a result of this I determined to effect a
      retirement to the Maubeuge position at daybreak on the 24th.</p>

      <p>A certain amount of fighting continued along the whole line throughout
      the night and at daybreak on the 24th the Second Division from the
      neighborhood of Harmignies made a powerful demonstration as if to retake
      Binche. This was supported by the artillery of both the First and Second
      Divisions, while the First Division took up a supporting position in the
      neighborhood of Peissant. Under cover of this demonstration the Second
      Corps retired on the line Dour-Quarouble-Frameries. The Third Division on
      the right of the corps suffered considerable loss in this operation from
      the enemy, who had retaken Mons.</p>

      <p>The Second Corps halted on this line, where they partially intrenched
      themselves, enabling Sir Douglas Haig with the First Corps gradually to
      withdraw to the new position; and he effected this without much further
      loss, reaching the line Bavai-Maubeuge about 7 P.M. Toward midday the
      enemy appeared to be directing his principal effort against our left.</p>

      <p>I had previously ordered Gen. Allenby with the cavalry to act
      vigorously in advance of my left front and endeavor to take the pressure
      off.</p>

      <p>About 7:30 A.M. Gen. Allenby received a message from Sir Charles
      Fergusson, commanding the Fifth Division, saying that he was very hard
      pressed and in urgent need of support. On receipt of this message Gen.
      Allenby drew in the cavalry and endeavored to bring direct support to the
      Fifth Division.</p>

      <p>During the course of this operation Gen. De Lisle, of the Second
      Cavalry Brigade, thought he saw a good opportunity to paralyze the
      further advance of the enemy's infantry by making a mounted attack on his
      flank.  He formed up and advanced for this purpose, but was held up by
      wire about 500 yards from his objective, and the Ninth Lancers and the
      Eighteenth Hussars suffered severely in the retirement of the
      brigade.</p>

      <p>The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade, which had been guarding the line of
      communications, was brought up by rail to Valenciennes on the 22d and
      23d. On the morning of the 24th they were moved out to a position south
      of Quarouble to support the left flank of the Second Corps.</p>

      <p>With the assistance of the cavalry Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien was
      enabled to effect his retreat to a new position; although, having two
      corps of the enemy on his front and one threatening his flank, he
      suffered great losses in doing so.</p>

      <p>At nightfall the position was occupied by the Second Corps to the west
      of Bavai, the First Corps to the right. The right was protected by the
      fortress of Maubeuge, the left by the Nineteenth Brigade in position
      between Jenlain and Bry, and the cavalry on the outer flank.</p>

      <p>4. The French were still retiring, and I had no support except such as
      was afforded by the Fortress of Maubeuge; and the determined attempts of
      the enemy to get round my left flank assured me that it was his intention
      to hem me against that place and surround me. I felt that not a moment
      must be lost in retiring to another position.</p>

      <p>I had every reason to believe that the enemy's forces were somewhat
      exhausted and I knew that they had suffered heavy losses. I hoped,
      therefore, that his pursuit would not be too vigorous to prevent me
      effecting my object.</p>

      <p>The operation, however, was full of danger and difficulty, not only
      owing to the very superior force in my front, but also to the exhaustion
      of the troops.</p>

      <p>The retirement was recommenced in the early morning of the 25th to a
      position in the neighborhood of Le Cateau, and rearguards were ordered to
      be clear of the Maubeuge-Bavai-Eth Road by 5:30 A.M.</p>

      <p>Two cavalry brigades, with the divisional cavalry of the Second Corps,
      covered the movement of the Second Corps. The remainder of the cavalry
      division, with the Nineteenth Brigade, the whole under the command of
      Gen. Allenby, covered the west flank.</p>

      <p>The Fourth Division commenced its detrainment at Le Cateau on Sunday,
      the 23d, and by the morning of the 25th eleven battalions and a brigade
      of artillery with divisional staff were available for service.</p>

      <p>I ordered Gen. Snow to move out to take up a position with his right
      south of Solesmes, his left resting on the Cambrai-Le Cateau Road south
      of La Chaprie. In this position the division rendered great help to the
      effective retirement of the Second and First Corps to the new
      position.</p>

      <p>Although the troops had been ordered to occupy the Cambrai-Le
      Cateau-Landrecies position, and the ground had, during the 25th, been
      partially prepared and intrenched, I had grave doubts&mdash;owing to the
      information I had received as to the accumulating strength of the enemy
      against me&mdash;as to the wisdom of standing there to fight.</p>

      <p>Having regard to the continued retirement of the French on my right,
      my exposed left flank, the tendency of the enemy's western corps (II.) to
      envelop me, and, more than all, the exhausted condition of the troops, I
      determined to make a great effort to continue the retreat till I could
      put some substantial obstacle, such as the Somme or the Oise, between my
      troops and the enemy, and afford the former some opportunity of rest and
      reorganization. Orders were, therefore, sent to the corps commanders to
      continue their retreat as soon as they possibly could toward the general
      line Vermand-St. Quentin-Ribemont.</p>

      <p>The cavalry, under Gen. Allenby, were ordered to cover the
      retirement.</p>

      <p>Throughout the 25th and far into the evening, the First Corps
      continued its march on Landrecies, following the road along the eastern
      border of the For&ecirc;t de Mormal, and arrived at Landrecies about 10
      o'clock. I had intended that the corps should come further west so as to
      fill up the gap between Le Cateau and Landrecies, but the men were
      exhausted and could not get further in without rest.</p>

      <p>The enemy, however, would not allow them this rest, and about 9:30
      P.M.  a report was received that the Fourth Guards Brigade in Landrecies
      was heavily attacked by troops of the Ninth German Army Corps, who were
      coming through the forest on the north of the town. This brigade fought
      most gallantly, and caused the enemy to suffer tremendous loss in issuing
      from the forest into the narrow streets of the town. This loss has been
      estimated from reliable sources at from 700 to 1,000. At the same time
      information reached me from Sir Douglas Haig that his First Division was
      also heavily engaged south and east of Maroilles. I sent urgent messages
      to the commander of the two French reserve divisions on my right to come
      up to the assistance of the First Corps, which they eventually did.
      Partly owing to this assistance, but mainly to the skillful manner in
      which Sir Douglas Haig extricated his corps from an exceptionally
      difficult position in the darkness of the night, they were able at dawn
      to resume their march south toward Wassigny on Guise.</p>

      <p>By about 6 P.M. the Second Corps had got into position with their
      right on Le Cateau, their left in the neighborhood of Caudry, and the
      line of defense was continued thence by the Fourth Division toward
      Seranvillers, the left being thrown back.</p>

      <p>During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the cavalry became a good
      deal scattered, but by the early morning of the 26th Gen, Allenby had
      succeeded in concentrating two brigades to the south of Cambrai.</p>

      <p>The Fourth Division was placed under the orders of the general officer
      commanding the Second Army Corps.</p>

      <p>On the 24th the French cavalry corps, consisting of three divisions
      under Gen. Sord&ecirc;t, had been in billets north of Avesnes. On my way
      back from Bavai, which was my "Poste de Commandement" during the fighting
      of the 23d and 24th, I visited Gen. Sord&ecirc;t, and earnestly requested
      his co-operation and support. He promised to obtain sanction from his
      army commander to act on my left flank, but said that his horses were too
      tired to move before the next day. Although he rendered me valuable
      assistance later on in the course of the retirement, he was unable for
      the reasons given to afford me any support on the most critical day of
      all, viz., the 26th.</p>

      <p>At daybreak it became apparent that the enemy was throwing the bulk of
      his strength against the left of the position occupied by the Second
      Corps and the Fourth Division.</p>

      <p>At this time the guns of four German army corps were in position
      against them, and Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that he judged
      it impossible to continue his retirement at daybreak (as ordered) in face
      of such an attack.</p>

      <p>I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavors to break off the action
      and retire at the earliest possible moment, as it was impossible for me
      to send him any support, the First Corps being at the moment incapable of
      movement.</p>

      <p>The French cavalry corps, under Gen. Sord&ecirc;t, was coming up on
      our left rear early in the morning, and I sent an urgent message to him
      to do his utmost to come up and support the retirement of my left flank;
      but owing to the fatigue of his horses he found himself unable to
      intervene in any way.</p>

      <p>There had been no time to intrench the position properly, but the troops
      showed a magnificent front to the terrible fire which confronted them.</p>

      <p>The artillery, although outmatched by at least four to one, made a
      splendid fight, and inflicted heavy losses on their opponents.</p>

      <p>At length it became apparent that, if complete annihilation was to be
      avoided, a retirement must be attempted; and the order was given to
      commence it about 3:30 P.M. The movement was covered with the most
      devoted intrepidity and determination by the artillery, which had itself
      suffered heavily, and the fine work done by the cavalry in the further
      retreat from the position assisted materially in the final completion of
      this most difficult and dangerous operation.</p>

      <p>Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered too heavily to engage in an
      energetic pursuit.</p>

      <p>I cannot close the brief account of this glorious stand of the British
      troops without putting on record my deep appreciation of the valuable
      services rendered by Gen. Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.</p>

      <p>I say without hesitation that the saving of the left wing of the army
      under my command on the morning of the 26th August could never have been
      accomplished unless a commander of rare and unusual coolness,
      intrepidity, and determination had been present to personally conduct the
      operation.</p>

      <p>The retreat was continued far into the night of the 26th and through
      the 27th and 28th, on which date the troops halted on the line
      Noyon-Chauny-La F&egrave;re, having then thrown off the weight of the
      enemy's pursuit.</p>

      <p>On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted to Gen. Sord&ecirc;t and the
      French cavalry division which he commands for materially assisting my
      retirement and successfully driving back some of the enemy on
      Cambrai.</p>

      <p>Gen. D'Amade also, with the Sixty-first and Sixty-second French
      Reserve Divisions, moved down from the neighborhood of Arras on the
      enemy's right flank and took much pressure off the rear of the British
      forces.</p>

      <p>This closes the period covering the heavy fighting which commenced at
      Mons on Sunday afternoon, 23d August, and which really constituted a four
      days' battle.</p>

      <p>At this point, therefore, I propose to close the present dispatch.</p>

      <p>I deeply deplore the very serious losses which the British forces have
      suffered in this great battle; but they were inevitable in view of the
      fact that the British Army&mdash;only two days after a concentration by
      rail&mdash;was called upon to withstand a vigorous attack of five German
      army corps.</p>

      <p>It is impossible for me to speak too highly of the skill evinced by
      the two general officers commanding army corps; the self-sacrificing and
      devoted exertions of their staffs; the direction of the troops by
      divisional, brigade, and regimental leaders; the command of the smaller
      units by their officers; and the magnificent fighting spirit displayed by
      non-commissioned officers and men.</p>

      <p>I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship's notice the admirable
      work done by the Royal Flying Corps under Sir David Henderson. Their
      skill, energy, and
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'perseverence']">perseverance</ins>
      have been beyond all praise. They have furnished me with the most
      complete and accurate information, which has been of incalculable value
      in the conduct of the operations. Fired at constantly both by friend and
      foe, and not hesitating to fly in every kind of weather, they have
      remained undaunted throughout.</p>

      <p>Further, by actually fighting in the air, they have succeeded in
      destroying five of the enemy's machines.</p>

      <p>I wish to acknowledge with deep gratitude the incalculable assistance
      I received from the General and Personal Staffs at Headquarters during
      this trying period.</p>

      <p>Lieut. Gen. Sir Archibald Murray, Chief of the General Staff; Major
      Gen.  Wilson, Sub-Chief of the General Staff; and all under them have
      worked day and night unceasingly with the utmost skill, self-sacrifice,
      and devotion; and the same acknowledgment is due by me to Brig. Gen. Hon.
      W.  Lambton, my Military Secretary, and the personal Staff.</p>

      <p>In such operations as I have described the work of the Quartermaster
      General is of an extremely onerous nature. Major Gen. Sir William
      Robertson has met what appeared to be almost insuperable difficulties
      with his characteristic energy, skill, and determination; and it is
      largely owing to his exertions that the hardships and sufferings of the
      troops&mdash;inseparable from such operations&mdash;were not much
      greater.</p>

      <p>Major Gen. Sir Nevil Macready, the Adjutant General, has also been
      confronted with most onerous and difficult tasks in connection with
      disciplinary arrangements and the preparation of casualty lists. He has

      <h3 class="two">The Battle of the Marne.</h3>

      <p class="right">7th September, 1914.</p>

      <p>MY LORD: In continuation of my dispatch of Sept. 7, I have the honor
      to report the further progress of the operations of the forces under my
      command from Aug. 28.</p>

      <p>On that evening the retirement of the force was followed closely by
      two of the enemy's cavalry columns, moving southeast from St.
      Quentin.</p>

      <p>The retreat in this part of the field was being covered by the Third
      and Fifth Cavalry Brigades. South of the Somme Gen. Gough, with the Third
      Cavalry Brigade, threw back the Uhlans of the Guard with considerable
      loss.</p>

      <p>Gen. Chetwode, with the Fifth Cavalry Brigade, encountered the eastern
      column near Cerizy, moving south. The brigade attacked and routed the
      column, the leading German regiment suffering very severe casualties and
      being almost broken up.</p>

      <p>The Seventh French Army Corps was now in course of being railed up
      from the south to the east of Amiens. On the 29th it nearly completed its
      detrainment, and the French Sixth Army got into position on my left, its
      right resting on Roye.</p>

      <p>The Fifth French Army was behind the line of the Oise, between La
      F&egrave;re and Guise.</p>

      <p>The pursuit of the enemy was very vigorous; some five or six German
      corps were on the Somme, facing the Fifth Army on the Oise. At least two
      corps were advancing toward my front, and were crossing the Somme east
      and west of Ham. Three or four more German corps
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'wree']">were</ins>
      opposing the Sixth French Army on my left.</p>

      <p>This was the situation at 1 o'clock on the 29th, when I received a
      visit from Gen. Joffre at my headquarters.</p>

      <p>I strongly represented my position to the French Commander in Chief,
      who was most kind, cordial, and sympathetic, as he has always been. He
      told me that he had directed the Fifth French Army on the Oise to move
      forward and attack the Germans on the Somme, with a view to checking
      pursuit. He also told me of the formation of the Sixth French Army on my
      left flank, composed of the Seventh Army Corps, four reserve divisions,
      and Sord&ecirc;t's corps of cavalry.</p>

      <p>I finally arranged with Gen. Joffre to effect a further short
      retirement toward the line Compi&egrave;gne-Soissons, promising him,
      however, to do my utmost to keep always within a day's march of him.</p>

      <p>In pursuance of this arrangement the British forces retired to a
      position a few miles north of the line Compi&egrave;gne-Soissons on the
      29th.</p>

      <p>The right flank of the German Army was now reaching a point which
      appeared seriously to endanger my line of communications with Havre. I
      had already evacuated Amiens, into which place a German reserve division
      was reported to have moved.</p>

         toward the line of the Grand Morin.</b></p>
      </div>

      <p>Orders were given to change the base to St. Nazaire, and establish an
      advance base at Le Mans. This operation was well carried out by the
      Inspector General of Communications.</p>

      <p>In spite of a severe defeat inflicted upon the Guard Tenth and Guard
      Reserve Corps of the German Army by the First and Third French Corps on
      the right of the Fifth Army, it was not part of Gen. Joffre's plan to
      pursue this advantage; and a general retirement to the line of the Marne
      was ordered, to which the French forces in the more eastern theatre were
      directed to conform.</p>

      <p>A new Army (the Ninth) had been formed from three corps in the south
      by Gen. Joffre, and moved into the space between the right of the Fifth
      and left of the Fourth Armies.</p>

      <p>While closely adhering to his strategic conception to draw the enemy
      on at all points until a favorable situation was created from which to
      assume the offensive, Gen. Joffre found it necessary to modify from day
      to day the methods by which he sought to attain this object, owing to the
      development of the enemy's plans and changes in the general
      situation.</p>

      <p>In conformity with the movements of the French forces, my retirement
      continued practically from day to day. Although we were not severely
      pressed by the enemy, rearguard actions took place continually.</p>

      <p>On the 1st September, when retiring from the thickly wooded country to
      the south of Compi&egrave;gne, the First Cavalry Brigade was overtaken by
      some German cavalry. They momentarily lost a horse artillery battery, and
      several officers and men were killed and wounded. With the help, however,
      of some detachments from the Third Corps operating on their left, they
      not only recovered their own guns, but succeeded in capturing twelve of
      the enemy's.</p>

      <p>Similarly, to the eastward, the First Corps, retiring south, also got
      into some very difficult forest country, and a somewhat severe rearguard
      action ensued at Villers-Cotterets, in which the Fourth Guards Brigade
      suffered considerably.</p>

      <p>On Sept. 3 the British forces were in position south of the Marne
      between Lagny and Signy-Signets. Up to this time I had been requested by
      Gen. Joffre to defend the passages of the river as long as possible, and
      to blow up the bridges in my front. After I had made the necessary
      dispositions, and the destruction of the bridges had been effected, I was
      asked by the French Commander in Chief to continue my retirement to a
      point some twelve miles in rear of the position I then occupied, with a
      view to taking up a second position behind the Seine. This retirement was
      duly carried out. In the meantime the enemy had thrown bridges and
      crossed the Marne in considerable force, and was threatening the Allies
      all along the line of the British forces and the Fifth and Ninth French
      Armies. Consequently several small outpost actions took place.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, Sept. 5, I met the French Commander in Chief at his
      request, and he informed me of his intention to take the offensive
      forthwith, as he considered conditions very favorable to success.</p>

      <p>Gen. Joffre announced to me his intention of wheeling up the left
      flank of the Sixth Army, pivoting on the Marne and directing it to move
      on the Ourcq; cross and attack the flank of the First German Army, which
      was then moving in a southeasterly direction east of that river.</p>

      <p>He requested me to effect a change of front to my right&mdash;my left
      resting on the Marne and my right on the Fifth Army&mdash;to fill the gap
      between that army and the Sixth. I was then to advance against the enemy
      in my front and join in the general offensive movement.</p>

      <p>These combined movements practically commenced on Sunday, Sept. 6, at
      sunrise; and on that day it may be said that a great battle opened on a
      front extending from Ermenonville, which was just in front of the left
      flank of the Sixth French Army, through Lizy on the Marne, Mauperthuis,
      which was about the British centre, Courtecon, which was on the left of
      the Fifth French Army, to Esternay and Charleville, the left of the Ninth
      Army under Gen. Foch, and so along the front of the Ninth, Fourth and
      Third French Armies to a point north of the fortress of Verdun.</p>

         The great advance to the Petit Morin and the Marne, where important
         captures were made by the British.</p>
      </div>

      <p>This battle, in so far as the Sixth French Army, the British Army, the
      Fifth French Army, and the Ninth French Army were concerned, may be said
      to have concluded on the evening of Sept. 10, by which time the Germans
      had been driven back to the line Soissons-Rheims, with a loss of
      thousands of prisoners, many guns, and enormous masses of transport.</p>

      <p>About Sept. 3 the enemy appears to have changed his plans and to have
      determined to stop his advance south direct upon Paris, for on Sept. 4
      air reconnoissances showed that his main columns were moving in a
      southeasterly direction generally east of a line drawn through Nanteuil
      and Lizy on the Ourcq.</p>

      <p>On Sept. 5 several of these columns were observed to have crossed the
      Marne, while German troops, which were observed moving southeast up the
      left flank of the Ourcq on the 4th, were now reported to be halted and
      facing that river. Heads of the enemy's columns were seen crossing at
      Changis, La Ferte, Nogent, Ch&acirc;teau Thierry, and Mezy.</p>

      <p>Considerable German columns of all arms were seen to be converging on
      Montmirail, while before sunset large bivouacs of the enemy were located
      in the neighborhood of Coulommiers, south of Rebais, La
      Fert&eacute;-Gaucher, and Dagny.</p>

      <p>I should conceive it to have been about noon on Sept. 6, after the
      British forces had changed their front to the right and occupied the line
      Jouy-Le Chatel-Faremoutiers-Villeneuve Le Comte, and the advance of the
      Sixth French Army north of the Marne toward the Ourcq became apparent,
      that the enemy realized the powerful threat that was being made against
      the flank of his columns moving southeast, and began the great retreat
      which opened the battle above referred to.</p>

      <p>On the evening of Sept. 6, therefore, the fronts and positions of the
      opposing armies were roughly as follows:</p>

      <h4>Allies.</h4>
      <p class="noindent"><i>Sixth French Army.</i>&mdash;Right on the Marne at Meux, left toward Betz.<br />
      <i>British Forces</i>.&mdash;On the line Dagny-Coulommiers-Maison.<br />
      <i>Fifth French Army</i>.&mdash;At Courtagon, right on Esternay.<br />
      <i>Conneau's Cavalry Corps</i>.&mdash;Between the right of the British and the
      left of the French Fifth Army.</p>

      <h4>Germans.</h4>
      <p class="noindent"><i>Fourth Reserve and Second Corps</i>.&mdash;East of the Ourcq and facing
      that river.<br />
      <i>Ninth Cavalry Division</i>.&mdash;West of Crecy.<br />
      <i>Second Cavalry Division</i>.&mdash;North of Coulommiers.<br />
      <i>Fourth Corps</i>.&mdash;Rebais.<br />
      <i>Third and Seventh Corps</i>.&mdash;Southwest of Montmirail.</p>

      <p>All these troops constituted the First German Army, which was directed
      against the French Sixth Army on the Ourcq, and the British forces, and
      the left of the Fifth French Army south of the Marne.</p>

      <p>The Second German Army (IX., X., X.R., and Guard) was moving against
      the centre and right of the Fifth French Army and the Ninth French
      Army.</p>

      <p>On Sept. 7 both the Fifth and Sixth French Armies were heavily engaged
      on our flank. The Second and Fourth Reserve German Corps on the Ourcq
      vigorously opposed the advance of the French toward that river, but did
      not prevent the Sixth Army from gaining some headway, the Germans
      themselves suffering serious losses. The French Fifth Army threw the
      enemy back to the line of the Petit Morin River after inflicting severe
      losses upon them, especially about Montceaux, which was carried at the
      point of the bayonet.</p>

      <p>The enemy retreated before our advance, covered by his Second and
      Ninth and Guard Cavalry Divisions, which suffered severely.</p>

      <p>Our cavalry acted with great vigor, especially Gen. De Lisle's
      brigade, with the Ninth Lancers and Eighteenth Hussars.</p>

      <p>On Sept. 8 the enemy continued his retreat northward, and our army was
      successfully engaged during the day with strong rearguards of all arms on
      the Petit Morin River, thereby materially assisting the progress of the
      French armies on our right and left, against whom the enemy was making
      his greatest efforts. On both sides the enemy was thrown back with very
      heavy loss. The First Army Corps encountered stubborn resistance at La
      Tr&eacute;toire, (north of Rabais.) The enemy occupied a strong position with
      infantry and guns on the northern bank of the Petit Morin River; they
      were dislodged with considerable loss. Several machine guns and many
      prisoners were captured, and upward of 200 German dead were left on the
      ground.</p>

         and many captures were made.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The forcing of the Petit Morin at this point was much assisted by the
      cavalry and the First Division, which crossed higher up the stream.</p>

      <p>Later in the day a counter-attack by the enemy was well repulsed by
      the First Army Corps, a great many prisoners and some guns again falling
      into our hands.</p>

      <p>On this day (Sept. 8) the Second Army Corps encountered considerable
      opposition, but drove back the enemy at all points with great loss,
      making considerable captures.</p>

      <p>The Third Army Corps also drove back considerable bodies of the
      enemy's infantry and made some captures.</p>

      <p>On Sept. 9 the First and Second Army Corps forced the passage of the
      Marne and advanced some miles to the north of it. The Third Corps
      encountered considerable opposition, as the bridge at La Fert&eacute; was
      destroyed and the enemy held the town on the opposite bank in some
      strength, and thence persistently obstructed the construction of a
      bridge; so the passage was not effected until after nightfall.</p>

      <p>During the day's pursuit the enemy suffered heavy loss in killed and
      wounded, some hundreds of prisoners fell into our hands and a battery of
      eight machine guns was captured by the Second Division.</p>

      <p>On this day the Sixth French Army was heavily engaged west of the
      River Ourcq. The enemy had largely increased his force opposing them; and
      very heavy fighting ensued, in which the French were successful
      throughout.</p>

      <p>The left of the Fifth French Army reached the neighborhood of
      Ch&acirc;teau Thierry after the most severe fighting, having driven the
      enemy completely north of the river with great loss.</p>

      <p>The fighting of this army in the neighborhood of Montmirail was very
      severe.</p>

      <p>The advance was resumed at daybreak on the 10th up to the line of the
      Ourcq, opposed by strong rearguards of all arms. The First and Second
      Corps, assisted by the cavalry divisions on the right, the Third and
      Fifth Cavalry Brigades on the left, drove the enemy northward. Thirteen
      guns, seven machine guns, about 2,000 prisoners, and quantities of
      transport fell into our hands. The enemy left many dead on the field. On
      this day the French Fifth and Sixth Armies had little opposition.</p>

      <p>As the First and Second German Armies were now in full retreat, this
      evening marks the end of the battle which practically commenced on the
      morning of the 6th inst.; and it is at this point in the operations that
      I am concluding the present dispatch.</p>

      <p>Although I deeply
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'regreat']">regret</ins>
      to have had to report heavy losses in killed and wounded throughout these
      operations, I do not think they have been excessive in view of the
      magnitude of the great fight, the outlines of which I have only been able
      very briefly to describe, and the demoralization and loss in killed and
      wounded which are known to have been caused to the enemy by the vigor and
      severity of the pursuit.</p>

      <p>In concluding this dispatch I must call your Lordship's special
      attention to the fact that from Sunday, Aug. 23, up to the present date,
      (Sept. 17,) from Mons back almost to the Seine, and from the Seine to the
      Aisne, the army under my command has been ceaselessly engaged without one
      single day's halt or rest of any kind.</p>

      <p>Since the date to which in this dispatch I have limited my report of
      the operations, a great battle on the Aisne has been proceeding. A full
      report of this battle will be made in an early further dispatch.</p>

      <p>It will, however, be of interest to say here that, in spite of a very
      determined resistance on the part of the enemy, who is holding in
      strength and great tenacity a position peculiarly favorable to defense,
      the battle which commenced on the evening of the 12th inst. has, so far,
      forced the enemy back from his first position, secured the passage of the
      river, and inflicted great loss upon him, including the capture of over
      2,000 prisoners and several guns. I have the honor to be your Lordship's
      most obedient servant,</p>

      <h3 class="one">III.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">The Battle of the Aisne.</h3>

      <p class="right">8th October, 1914.</p>

      <p>MY LORD: I have the honor to report the operations in which the
      British forces in France have been engaged since the evening of Sept.
      10:</p>

      <p>1. In the early morning of the 11th the further pursuit of the enemy
      was commenced, and the three corps crossed the Ourcq practically
      unopposed, the cavalry reaching the line of the Aisne River, the Third
      and Fifth Brigades south of Soissons, the First, Second and the Fourth on
      the high ground at Couvrelles and Cerseuil.</p>

      <p>On the afternoon of the 12th, from the opposition encountered by the
      Sixth French Army to the west of Soissons, by the Third Corps southeast
      of that place, by the Second Corps south of Missy and Vailly, and certain
      indications all along the line, I formed the opinion that the enemy had,
      for the moment at any rate, arrested his retreat and was preparing to
      dispute the passage of the Aisne with some vigor.</p>

      <p>South of Soissons the Germans were holding Mont de Paris against the
      attack of the right of the French Sixth Army when the Third Corps reached
      the neighborhood of Buzancy, southeast of that place. With the assistance
      of the artillery of the Third Corps the French drove them back across the
      river at Soissons, where they destroyed the bridges.</p>

      <p>The heavy artillery fire which was visible for several miles in a
      westerly direction in the valley of the Aisne showed that the Sixth
      French Army was meeting with strong opposition all along the line.</p>

      <p>On this day the cavalry under Gen. Allenby reached the neighborhood of
      Braine and did good work in clearing the town and the high ground beyond
      it of strong hostile detachments. The Queen's Bays are particularly
      mentioned by the General as having assisted greatly in the success of
      this operation. They were well supported by the Third Division, which on
      this night bivouacked at Brenelle, south of the river.</p>

      <p>The Fifth Division approached Missy, but were unable to make
      headway.</p>

      <p>The First Army Corps reached the neighborhood of
      Vauxc&eacute;r&eacute; without much opposition.</p>

      <p>In this manner the battle of the Aisne commenced.</p>

      <p>2. The Aisne Valley runs generally east and west, and consists of a
      flat-bottomed depression of width varying from half a mile to two miles,
      down which the river follows a winding course to the west, at some points
      near the southern slopes of the valley and at others near the northern.
      The high ground both on the north and south of the river is approximately
      400 feet above the bottom of the valley, and is very similar in
      character, as are both slopes of the valley itself, which are broken into
      numerous rounded spurs and re-entrants. The most prominent of the former
      are the Chivre spur on the right bank and Sermoise spur on the left. Near
      the latter place the general plateau, on the south is divided by a
      subsidiary valley of much the same character, down which the small River
      Vesle flows to the main stream near Sermoise. The slopes of the plateau
      overlooking the Aisne on the north and south are of varying steepness,
      and are covered with numerous patches of wood, which also stretch upward
      and backward over the edge on to the top of the high ground. There are
      several villages and small towns dotted about in the valley itself and
      along its sides, the chief of which is the town of Soissons.</p>

      <p>The Aisne is a sluggish stream of some 170 feet in breadth, but, being
      15 feet deep in the centre, it is unfordable. Between Soissons on the
      west and Villiers on the east (the part of the river attacked and secured
      by the British forces) there are eleven road bridges across it.  On the
      north bank a narrow-gauge railway runs from Soissons to Vailly, where it
      crosses the river and continues eastward along the south bank.  From
      Soissons to Sermoise a double line of railway runs along the south bank,
      turning at the latter place up the Vesle Valley toward Bazoches.</p>

      <p>The position held by the enemy is a very strong one, either for
      delaying action or for a defensive battle. One of its chief military
      characteristics is that from the high ground on neither side can the top
      of the plateau on the other side be seen, except for small stretches.
      This is chiefly due to the woods on the edges of the slopes. Another
      important point is that all the bridges are under direct or high-angle
      artillery fire.</p>

      <p>The tract of country above described, which lies north of the Aisne,
      is well adapted to concealment, and was so skillfully turned to account
      by the enemy as to render it impossible to judge the real nature of his
      opposition to our passage of the river or accurately to gauge his
      strength; but I have every reason to conclude that strong rearguards of
      at least three army corps were holding the passages on the early morning
      of the 13th.</p>

      <p>3. On that morning I ordered the British forces to advance and make
      good the Aisne.</p>

      <p>The First Corps and the cavalry advanced on the river. The First
      Division was directed on Chamouille via the canal bridge at Bourg, and
      the Second Division on Courte&ccedil;on and Presles via Pont-Arcy, and on
      the canal to the north of Braye via Chavonne. On the right the cavalry
      and First Division met with slight opposition and found a passage by
      means of the canal, which crosses the river by an aqueduct. The division
      was therefore able to press on, supported by the cavalry division on its
      outer flank, driving back the enemy in front of it.</p>

      <p>On the left the leading troops of the Second Division reached the
      river by 9 o'clock. The Fifth Infantry Brigade were only enabled to
      cross, in single file and under considerable shell fire, by means of the
      broken girder of the bridge, which was not entirely submerged in the
      river. The construction of a pontoon bridge was at once undertaken, and
      was completed by 5 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

      <p>On the extreme left the Fourth Guards Brigade met with severe
      opposition at Chavonne, and it was only late in the afternoon that it was
      able to establish a foothold on the northern bank of the river by
      ferrying one battalion across in boats.</p>

      <p>By nightfall the First Division occupied the area of
      Moulins-Paissy-Geny, with posts at the village of Vendresse.</p>

      <p>The Second Division bivouacked as a whole on the southern bank of the
      river, leaving only the Fifth Brigade on the north bank to establish a
      bridge-head.</p>

      <p>The Second Corps found all the bridges in front of them destroyed
      except that of Cond&eacute;, which was in possession of the enemy, and
      remained so until the end of the battle.</p>

      <p>In the approach to Missy, where the Fifth Division eventually crossed,
      there is some open ground which was swept by a heavy fire from the
      opposite bank. The Thirteenth Brigade was therefore unable to advance;
      but the Fourteenth, which was directed to the east of Venizel at a less
      exposed point, was rafted across, and by night established itself with
      its left at St. Margu&eacute;rite. They were followed by the Fifteenth
      Brigade; and later on both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth supported the
      Fourth Division on their left in repelling a heavy counter-attack on the
      Third Corps.</p>

      <p>On the morning of the 13th the Third Corps found the enemy had
      established himself in strength on the Vregny plateau. The road bridge at
      Venizel was repaired during the morning, and a reconnoissance was made
      with a view to throwing a pontoon bridge at Soissons.</p>

      <p>The Twelfth Infantry Brigade crossed at Venizel, and was assembled at
      Bucy le Long by 1 P.M., but the bridge was so far damaged that artillery
      could only be man-handled across it. Meanwhile the construction of a
      bridge was commenced close to the road bridge at Venizel.</p>

      <p>At 2 P.M. the Twelfth Infantry Brigade attacked in the direction of
      Chivres and Vregny with the object of securing the high ground east of
      Chivres, as a necessary preliminary to a further advance northward. This
      attack made good progress, but at 5:30 P.M. the enemy's artillery and
      machine gun fire from the direction of Vregny became so severe that no
      further advance could be made. The positions reached were held till
      dark.</p>

      <p>The pontoon bridge at Venizel was completed at 5:30 P.M., when the
      Tenth Infantry Brigade crossed the river and moved to Bucy le Long.</p>

      <p>The Nineteenth Infantry Brigade moved to Billy-sur-Aisne, and before
      dark all the artillery of the division had crossed the river, with the
      exception of the heavy battery and one brigade of field artillery.</p>

      <p>During the night the positions gained by the Twelfth Infantry Brigade
      to the east of the stream running through Chivres were handed over to the
      Fifth Division.</p>

      <p>The section of the bridging train allotted to the Third Corps began to
      arrive in the neighborhood of Soissons late in the afternoon, when an
      attempt to throw a heavy pontoon bridge at Soissons had to be abandoned,
      owing to the fire of the enemy's heavy howitzers.</p>

      <p>In the evening the enemy retired at all points and intrenched himself
      on the high ground about two miles north of the river, along which runs
      the Chemin-des-Dames. Detachments of infantry, however, strongly
      intrenched in commanding points down slopes of the various spurs, were
      left in front of all three corps with powerful artillery in support of
      them.</p>

      <p>During the night of the 13th and on the 14th and following days the
      field companies were incessantly at work night and day. Eight pontoon
      bridges and one foot bridge were thrown across the river under generally
      very heavy artillery fire, which was incessantly kept up on to most of
      the crossings after completion. Three of the road bridges, i.e., Venizel,
      Missy, and Vailly, and the railway bridge east of Vailly, were
      temporarily repaired so as to take foot traffic, and the Villiers Bridge
      made fit to carry weights up to six tons.</p>

      <p>Preparations were also made for the repair of the Missy, Vailly and
      Bourg bridges so as to take mechanical transport.</p>

      <p>The weather was very wet and added to the difficulties by cutting up
      the already indifferent approaches, entailing a large amount of work to
      repair and improve.</p>

      <p>The operations of the field companies during this most trying time are
      worthy of the best traditions of the Royal Engineers.</p>

      <p>4. On the evening of the 14th it was still impossible to decide
      whether the enemy was only making a temporary halt, covered by
      rearguards, or whether he intended to stand and defend the position.</p>

      <p>With a view to clearing up the situation I ordered a general
      advance.</p>

      <p>The action of the First Corps on this day under the direction and
      command of Sir Douglas Haig was of so skillful, bold, and decisive a
      character that he gained positions which alone have enabled me to
      maintain my position for more than three weeks of very severe fighting on
      the north bank of the river.</p>

      <p>The corps was directed to cross the line Moulins-Moussy by 7 A.M.</p>

      <p>On the right the General Officer commanding the First Division
      directed the Second Infantry Brigade (which was in billets and bivouacked
      about Moulins), and the Twenty-fifth Artillery Brigade (less one
      battery), under Gen. Bulfin, to move forward before daybreak, in order to
      protect the advance of the division sent up the valley to Vendresse. An
      officer's patrol sent out by this brigade reported a considerable force
      of the enemy near the factory north of Troyon, and the Brigadier
      accordingly directed two regiments (the King's Royal Rifles and the Royal
      Sussex Regiment) to move at 3 A.M. The Northamptonshire Regiment was
      ordered to move at 4 A.M. to occupy the spur east of Troyon. The
      remaining regiment of the brigade (the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment)
      moved at 5:30 A.M. to the village of Vendresse. The factory was found to
      be held in considerable strength by the enemy, and the Brigadier ordered
      the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment to support the King's Royal Rifles
      and the Sussex Regiment. Even with this support the force was unable to
      make headway, and on the arrival of the First Brigade the Coldstream
      Guards were moved up to support the right of the leading brigade (the
      Second), while the remainder of the First Brigade supported its left.</p>

         headlong retreat to their intrenched positions beyond the
         Aisne.</b></p>
      </div>

      <p>About noon the situation was, roughly, that the whole of these two
      brigades were extended along a line running east and west, north of the
      line Troyon and south of the Chemin-des-Dames. A party of the Loyal North
      Lancashire Regiment had seized and were holding the factory. The enemy
      had a line of intrenchments north and east of the factory in considerable
      strength, and every effort to advance against this line was driven back
      by heavy shell and machine-gun fire. The morning was wet and a heavy mist
      hung over the hills, so that the Twenty-fifth Artillery Brigade and the
      divisional artillery were unable to render effective support to the
      advanced troops until about 9 o'clock.</p>

      <p>By 10 o'clock the Third Infantry Brigade had reached a point one mile
      south of Vendresse, and from there it was ordered to continue the line of
      the First Brigade and to connect with and help the right of the Second
      Division. A strong hostile column was found to be advancing, and by a
      vigorous counterstroke with two of his battalions the Brigadier checked
      the advance of this column and relieved the pressure on the Second
      Division. From this period until late in the afternoon the fighting
      consisted of a series of attacks and counter-attacks. The
      counter-strokers by the enemy were delivered at first with great vigor,
      but later on they decreased in strength, and all were driven off with
      heavy loss.</p>

      <p>On the left the Sixth Infantry Brigade had been ordered to cross the
      river and to pass through the line held during the preceding night by the
      Fifth Infantry Brigade and occupy the Courte&ccedil;on Ridge, while a
      detached force, consisting of the Fourth Guards Brigade and the
      Thirty-sixth Brigade Royal Field Artillery, under Brig. Gen. Perceval,
      were ordered to proceed to a point east of the village of Ostel.</p>

      <p>The Sixth Infantry Brigade crossed the river at Pont-Arcy, moved up
      the valley toward Braye, and at 9 A.M. had reached the line
      Tilleul-La-Buvelle. On the line they came under heavy artillery and rifle
      fire, and were unable to advance until supported by the Thirty-fourth
      Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, and the Forty-fourth Howitzer Brigade and
      the Heavy Artillery.</p>

      <p>The Fourth Guards Brigade crossed the river at 10 A.M. and met with
      very heavy opposition. It had to pass through dense woods; field
      artillery support was difficult to obtain; but one section of a field
      battery pushed up to and within the firing line. At 1 P.M. the left of
      the brigade was south of the Ostel Ridge.</p>

      <p>At this period of the action the enemy obtained a footing between the
      First and Second Corps, and threatened to cut the communications of the
      latter.</p>

      <p>Sir Douglas Haig was very hardly pressed and had no reserve in hand. I
      placed the cavalry division at his disposal, part of which he skillfully
      used to prolong and secure the left flank of the Guards Brigade. Some
      heavy fighting ensued, which resulted in the enemy being driven back with
      heavy loss.</p>

      <p>About 4 o'clock the weakening of the counter-attacks by the enemy and
      other indications tended to show that his resistance was decreasing, and
      a general advance was ordered by the army corps commander. Although
      meeting with considerable opposition and coming under very heavy
      artillery and rifle fire, the position of the corps at the end of the
      day's operations extended from the Chemin-des-Dames on the right, through
      Chivy, to Le Cour de Soupir, with the First Cavalry Brigade extending to
      the Chavonne-Soissons road.</p>

      </div>

      <p>On the right the corps was in close touch with the French Moroccan
      troops of the Eighteenth Corps, which were intrenched in echelon to its
      right rear. During the night they intrenched this position.</p>

      <p>Throughout the battle of the Aisne this advanced and commanding
      position was maintained, and I cannot speak too highly of the valuable
      services rendered by Sir Douglas Haig and the army corps under his
      command. Day after day and night after night the enemy's infantry has
      been hurled against him in violent counter-attack, which has never on any
      one occasion succeeded, while the trenches all over his position have
      been under continuous heavy artillery fire.</p>

      <p>The operations of the First Corps on this day resulted in the capture
      of several hundred prisoners, some field pieces and machine guns.</p>

      <p>The casualties were very severe, one brigade alone losing three of its
      four Colonels.</p>

      <p>The Third Division commenced a further advance, and had nearly reached
      the plateau of Aizy when they were driven back by a powerful
      counter-attack supported by heavy artillery. The division, however, fell
      back in the best order, and finally intrenched itself about a mile north
      of Vailly Bridge, effectively covering the passage.</p>

      <p>The Fourth and Fifth Divisions were unable to do more than maintain
      their ground.</p>

      <p>5. On the morning of the 15th, after close examination of the
      position, it became clear to me that the enemy was making a determined
      stand; and this view was confirmed by reports which reached me from the
      French armies fighting on my right and left, which clearly showed that a
      strongly intrenched line of defense was being taken up from the north of
      Compi&egrave;gne, eastward and southeastward, along the whole Valley of
      the Aisne up to and beyond Rheims.</p>

      <p>A few days previously the Fortress of Maubeuge fell, and a
      considerable quantity of siege artillery was brought down from that place
      to strengthen the enemy's position in front of us.</p>

      <p>During the 15th shells fell in our position which have been judged by
      experts to be thrown by eight-inch siege guns with a range of 10,000
      yards. Throughout the whole course of the battle our troops have suffered
      very heavily from this fire, although its effect latterly was largely
      mitigated by more efficient and thorough intrenching, the necessity for
      which I impressed strongly upon army corps commanders. In order to assist
      them in this work all villages within the area of our occupation were
      searched for heavy intrenching tools, a large number of which were
      collected.</p>

      <p>In view of the peculiar formation of the ground on the north side of
      the river between Missy and Soissons, and its extraordinary adaptability
      to a force on the defensive, the Fifth Division found it impossible to
      maintain its position on the southern edge of the Chivres Plateau, as the
      enemy in possession of the Village of Vregny to the west was able to
      bring a flank fire to bear upon it. The division had, therefore, to
      retire to a line the left of which was at the village of
      Margu&eacute;rite, and thence ran by the north edge of Missy back to the
      river to the east of that place.</p>

      <p>With great skill and tenacity Sir Charles Fergusson maintained this
      position throughout the whole battle, although his trenches were
      necessarily on lower ground than that occupied by the enemy on the
      southern edge of the plateau, which was only 400 yards away.</p>

      <p>Gen. Hamilton with the Third Division vigorously attacked to the
      north, and regained all the ground he had lost on the 15th, which
      throughout the battle has formed a most powerful and effective
      bridge-head.</p>

      <p>6. On the 16th the Sixth Division came up into line.</p>

      <p>It had been my intention to direct the First Corps to attack and seize
      the enemy's position on the Chemin-des-Dames, supporting it with this new
      reinforcement. I hoped, from the position thus gained, to bring effective
      fire to bear across the front of the Third Division, which, by securing
      the advance of the latter, would also take the pressure off the Fifth
      Division and the Third Corps.</p>

      <p>But any further advance of the First Corps would have dangerously
      exposed my right flank. And, further, I learned from the French Commander
      in Chief that he was strongly reinforcing the Sixth French Army on my
      left, with the intention of bringing up the allied left to attack the
      enemy's flank, and thus compel his retirement. I therefore sent the Sixth
      Division to join the Third Corps, with orders to keep it on the south
      side of the river, as it might be available in general reserve.</p>

      <p>On the 17th, 18th, and 19th the whole of our line was heavily
      bombarded, and the First Corps was constantly and heavily engaged. On the
      afternoon of the 17th the right flank of the First Division was seriously
      threatened. A counter-attack was made by the Northamptonshire Regiment in
      combination with the Queen's, and one battalion of the Divisional Reserve
      was moved up in support. The Northamptonshire Regiment, under cover of
      mist, crept up to within a hundred yards of the enemy's trenches and
      charged with the bayonet, driving them out of the trenches and up the
      hill. A very strong force of hostile infantry was then disclosed on the
      crest line. This new line was enfiladed by part of the Queen's and the
      King's Royal Rifles, which wheeled to their left on the extreme right of
      our infantry line, and were supported by a squadron of cavalry on their
      outer flank. The enemy's attack was ultimately driven back with heavy
      loss.</p>

      <p>On the 18th, during the night, the Gloucestershire Regiment advanced
      from their position near Chivy, filled in the enemy's trenches, and
      captured two Maxim guns.</p>

      <p>On the extreme right the Queen's were heavily attacked, but the enemy
      was repulsed with great loss. About midnight the attack was renewed on
      the First Division, supported by artillery fire, but was again
      repulsed.</p>

      <p>Shortly after midnight an attack was made on the left of the Second
      Division with considerable force, which was also thrown back.</p>

      <p>At about 1 P.M. on the 19th the Second Division drove back a heavy
      infantry attack strongly supported by artillery fire. At dusk the attack
      was renewed and again repulsed.</p>

      <p>On the 18th I discussed with the General Officer commanding the Second
      Army Corps and his divisional commanders the possibility of driving the
      enemy out of Cond&eacute;, which lay between his two divisions, and
      seizing the bridge, which has remained throughout in his possession.</p>

      <p>As, however, I found that the bridge was closely commanded from all
      points on the south side, and that satisfactory arrangements were made to
      prevent any issue from it by the enemy by day or night, I decided that it
      was not necessary to incur the losses which an attack would entail, as,
      in view of the position of the Second and Third Corps, the enemy could
      make no use of Cond&eacute;, and would be automatically forced out of it
      by any advance which might become possible for us.</p>

      <p>7. On this day information reached me from Gen. Joffre that he had
      found it necessary to make a new plan and to attack and envelop the
      German right flank.</p>

      <p>It was now evident to me that the battle in which we had been engaged
      since the 12th inst. must last some days longer, until the effect of this
      new flank movement could be felt and a way opened to drive the enemy from
      his positions.</p>

      <p>It thus became essential to establish some system of regular relief in
      the trenches, and I have used the infantry of the Sixth Division for this
      purpose with good results. The relieved brigades were brought back
      alternately south of the river and, with the artillery of the Sixth
      Division, formed a general reserve on which I could rely in case of
      necessity.</p>

      <p>The cavalry has rendered most efficient and ready help in the
      trenches, and have done all they possibly could to lighten the arduous
      and trying task which has of necessity fallen to the lot of the
      infantry.</p>

      <p>On the evening of the 19th and throughout the 20th the enemy again
      commenced to show considerable activity. On the former night a severe
      counter-attack on the Third Division was repulsed with considerable loss,
      and from early on Sunday morning various hostile attempts were made on
      the trenches of the First Division. During the day the enemy suffered
      another severe repulse in front of the Second Division, losing heavily in
      the attempt. In the course of the afternoon the enemy made desperate
      attempts against the trenches all along the front of the First Corps, but
      with similar results.</p>

      <p>After dark the enemy again attacked the Second Division, only to be
      again driven back.</p>

      <p>Our losses on these two days were considerable, but the number, as
      obtained, of the enemy's killed and wounded vastly exceeded them.</p>

      <p>As the troops of the First Army Corps were much exhausted by this
      continual fighting, I reinforced Sir Douglas Haig with a brigade from the
      reserve, and called upon the First Cavalry Division to assist them.</p>

      <p>On the night of the 21st another violent counter-attack was repulsed
      by the Third Division, the enemy losing heavily.</p>

      <p>On the 23d the four 6-inch howitzer batteries, which I had asked to be
      sent from home, arrived. Two batteries were handed over to the Second
      Corps and two to the First Corps. They were brought into action on the
      24th with very good results.</p>

      <p>Our experiences in this campaign seem to point to the employment of
      more heavy guns of a larger calibre in great battles which last for
      several days, during which time powerful intrenching work on both sides
      can be carried out. These batteries were used with considerable effect on
      the 24th and the following days.</p>

      <p>8. On the 23d the action of Gen. de Castelnau's army on the allied
      left developed considerably, and apparently withdrew considerable forces
      of the enemy away from the centre and east. I am not aware whether it was
      due to this cause or not, but until the 26th it appeared as though the
      enemy's opposition in our front was weakening. On that day, however, a
      very marked renewal of activity commenced. A constant and vigorous
      artillery bombardment was maintained all day, and the Germans in front of
      the First Division were observed to be "sapping" up to our lines and
      trying to establish new trenches. Renewed counter-attacks were delivered
      and beaten off during the course of the day, and in the afternoon a
      well-timed attack by the First Division stopped the enemy's intrenching
      work.</p>

      <p>During the night of the 27th-28th the enemy again made the most
      determined attempts to capture the trenches of the First Division, but
      without the slightest success.</p>

      <p>Similar attacks were reported during these three days all along the
      line of the allied front, and it is certain that the enemy then made one
      last great effort to establish ascendency. He was, however, unsuccessful
      everywhere, and is reported to have suffered heavy losses. The same
      futile attempts were made all along our front up to the evening of the
      28th, when they died away, and have not since been renewed.</p>

      <p>On former occasions I have brought to your Lordship's notice the
      valuable services performed during this campaign by the Royal
      Artillery.</p>

      <p>Throughout the battle of the Aisne they have displayed the same skill,
      endurance, and tenacity, and I deeply appreciate the work they have
      done.</p>

      <p>Sir David Henderson and the Royal Flying Corps under his command have
      again proved their incalculable value. Great strides have been made in
      the development of the use of aircraft in the tactical sphere by
      establishing effective communication between aircraft and units in
      action.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to describe adequately and accurately the great strain
      to which officers and men were subjected almost every hour of the day and
      night throughout this battle.</p>

      <p>I have described above the severe character of the artillery fire
      which was directed from morning till night not only upon the trenches,
      but over the whole surface of the ground occupied by our forces. It was
      not until a few days before the position was evacuated that the heavy
      guns were removed and the fire slackened. Attack and counter-attack
      occurred at all hours of the night and day throughout the whole position,
      demanding extreme vigilance, and permitting only a minimum of rest.</p>

      <p>The fact that between Sept. 12 to the date of this dispatch the total
      numbers of killed, wounded, and missing reached the figures amounting to
      561 officers, 12,980 men, proves the severity of the struggle.</p>

      <p>The tax on the endurance of the troops was further increased by the
      heavy rain and cold which prevailed for some ten or twelve days of this
      trying time.</p>

      <p>The battle of the Aisne has once more demonstrated the splendid
      spirit, gallantry, and devotion which animates the officers and men of
      his Majesty's forces.</p>

      <p>With reference to the last paragraph of my dispatch of Sept. 7, I
      append the names of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men brought
      forward for special mention by army corps commanders and heads of
      departments for services rendered from the commencement of the campaign
      up to the present date.</p>

      <p>I entirely agree with these recommendations and beg to submit them for
      your Lordship's consideration.</p>

      <p>I further wish to bring forward the names of the following officers
      who have rendered valuable service: Gen. Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien and
      Lieut.  Gen. Sir Douglas Haig (commanding First and Second Corps,
      respectively) I have already mentioned in the present and former
      dispatches for particularly marked and distinguished service in critical
      situations.</p>

      <p>Since the commencement of the campaign they have carried out all my
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'orders.']">orders</ins>
      and instructions with the utmost ability.</p>

      <p>Lieut. Gen. W.P. Pulteney took over the command of the Third Corps
      just before the commencement of the battle of the Marne. Throughout the
      subsequent operations he showed himself to be a most capable commander in
      the field, and has rendered very valuable services.</p>

      <p>Major Gen. E.H.H. Allenby and Major Gen. H. De La P. Gough have proved
      themselves to be cavalry leaders of a high order, and I am deeply
      indebted to them. The undoubted moral superiority which our cavalry has
      obtained over that of the enemy has been due to the skill with which they
      have turned to the best account the qualities inherent in the splendid
      troops they command.</p>

      <p>In my dispatch of the 7th September I mentioned the name of Brig. Gen.
      Sir David Henderson and his valuable work in command of the Royal Flying
      Corps; and I have once more to express my deep appreciation of the help
      he has since rendered me.</p>

      <p>Lieut. Gen. Sir Archibald Murray has continued to render me invaluable
      help as Chief of the Staff; and in his arduous and responsible duties he
      has been ably assisted by Major Gen. Henry Wilson, Sub-Chief.</p>

      <p>Lieut. Gen. Sir Nevil Macready and Lieut. Gen. Sir William Robertson
      have continued to perform excellent service as Adjutant General and
      Quartermaster General, respectively.</p>

      <p>The Director of Army Signals, Lieut. Col. J.S. Fowler, has materially
      assisted the operations by the skill and energy which he has displayed in
      the working of the important department over which he presides.</p>

      <p>My Military Secretary, Brig. Gen. the Hon. W. Lambton, has performed
      his arduous and difficult duties with much zeal and great efficiency.</p>

      <p>I am anxious also to bring to your Lordship's notice the following
      names of officers of my personal staff, who throughout these arduous
      operations have shown untiring zeal and energy in the performance of
      their duties:</p>

      staff as Aide de Camp on the 14th September.</p>

      <p>His Royal Highness's intimate knowledge of languages enabled me to
      employ him with great advantage on confidential missions of some
      importance, and his services have proved of considerable value.</p>

      <p>I cannot close this dispatch without informing your Lordship of the
      valuable services rendered by the Chief of the French Military Mission at
      my headquarters, Col. Victor Huguet of the French Artillery. He has
      displayed tact and judgment of a high order in many difficult situations,
      and has rendered conspicuous service to the allied cause. I have the

      <h3 class="two">The Battle in Flanders.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Official Abstract of Report for The Associated Press.]</p>

      <p>LONDON, Nov. 29.&mdash;A report from Field Marshal Sir John French
      covering the period of the battle in Flanders and the days immediately
      preceding it, issued today by the Official Press Bureau, shows that this
      battle was brought about, first, by the Allies' attempts to outflank the
      Germans, who countered, and then by the Allies' plans to move to the
      northeast to Ghent and Bruges, which also failed. After this the German
      offensive began, with the French coast ports as the objective, but this
      movement, like those of the Allies, met with failure.</p>

      <p>The Field Marshal, doubtless in response to the demands of the British
      public, tells what the various units of the expeditionary force have been
      doing&mdash;those that failed and were cut off and those who against
      superior numbers held the trenches for a month. He gives it as his
      opinion that the German losses have been thrice as great as those of the
      Allies, and speaks optimistically of the future.</p>

      <p>The report covers in a general way the activities of the British
      troops from Oct. 11 to Nov. 20.</p>

      <p>Summing up the situation in concluding his report, the Field Marshal
      says:</p>

      <p>"As I close this dispatch, signs are in evidence that we are possibly
      in the last stages of the battle from Ypres to Armenti&egrave;res. For
      several days past the artillery fire of the enemy has slackened
      considerably, and his infantry attacks have practically ceased."</p>

      <p>Discussing the general military situation of the Allies, as it appears
      to him at the time of writing, Sir John says:</p>

      <p>"It does not seem to be clearly understood that the operations in
      which we have been engaged embrace nearly all of the central part of the
      Continent of Europe, from the east to the west. The combined French,
      Belgian, and British Armies in the west and the Russian Army in the east
      are opposed to the united forces of Germany and Austria, acting as
      combined armies between us.</p>

      <p>"Our enemies elected at the commencement of the war to throw the
      weight of their forces against our armies in the west and to detach only
      a comparatively weak force, composed of very few of the first line troops
      and several corps of second and third line troops, to stem the Russian
      advance until the western forces could be defeated and overwhelmed.
      Their strength enabled them from the outset to throw greatly superior
      forces against us in the west. This precludes the possibility of our
      taking vigorous offensive action except when miscalculations and mistakes
      are made by their commanders, opening up special opportunities for
      successful attacks and pursuit.</p>

      <p>"The battle of the Marne was an example of this, as was also our
      advance from St. Omer and Hazebrouck to the line of the River Lys at the
      commencement of this battle. The r&ocirc;le which our armies in the west
      have consequently been called upon to fulfill has been to occupy strong
      defensive positions, holding ground gained and inviting the enemy's
      attack, and to throw back these attacks, causing the enemy heavy losses
      in his retreat and following him up with powerful and successful
      counter-attacks to complete his discomfiture.</p>

      <p>"The value and significance of operations of this nature since the
      commencement of hostilities by the Allies' forces in the west lie in the
      fact that at the moment when the eastern provinces of Germany are in
      imminent danger of being overrun by the numerous and powerful armies of
      Russia, nearly the whole active army of Germany is tied down to a line of
      trenches extending from Verdun, on the Alsatian frontier, to the sea at
      Nieuport, east of Dunkirk, a distance of 260 miles, where they are held,
      with much reduced numbers and impaired morale, by the successful action
      of our troops in the west.</p>

      <p>"I cannot speak too highly of the services rendered by the Royal
      Artillery throughout the battle. In spite of the fact that the enemy
      brought up in support of his attacks guns of great range and shell power,
      our men have succeeded throughout in preventing the enemy from
      establishing anything in the nature of superiority in artillery. The
      skill, courage, and energy displayed by the commanders of the Royal
      Artillery have been very marked. The Royal Engineers have been
      indefatigable in their efforts to assist the infantry in field,
      fortification, and trench work.</p>

      <p>"I deeply regret the heavy casualties which we have suffered, but the
      nature of the fighting has been very desperate, and we have been assailed
      by vastly superior numbers. I have every reason to know that throughout
      the course of the battle we have placed at least three times as many of
      the enemy hors de combat in dead, wounded and prisoners.</p>

      <p>"Throughout these operations Gen. Foch has strained his resources to
      the utmost to afford me all the support he could. An expression of my
      warm gratitude is also due to Gen. Dubail, commanding the Eighth French
      Army Corps on my left, and to Gen. de Maud'huy, commanding the Tenth Army
      Corps on my right."</p>

      <p>Discussing the details of the engagement from Ypres to
      Armenti&egrave;res, Field Marshal Sir John French explains that he was
      impressed early in October with the necessity of giving the greatest
      possible support to the northern flank of the Allies in the effort to
      outflank the Germans and compel them to evacuate their positions. He says
      that the situation on the Aisne warranted the withdrawal of British
      troops from positions they held there, as the enemy had been weakened by
      continual attacks and the fortifications of the Allies much improved.</p>

      <p>The Field Marshal made known his view to Gen. Joffre, who agreed with
      it. The French General Staff arranged for the withdrawal of the British,
      which began on Oct. 3 and was completed on Oct. 19, when the First Army
      Corps, under Gen. Sir Douglas Haig detrained at St. Omer.</p>

      <p>The general plan, as arranged by Field Marshal French and Gen. Foch,
      commanding the French troops to the north of Noyon, was that the English
      should pivot on the French at Bethune, attacking the Germans on their
      flank and forcing their way north. In the event that the British forced
      the Germans out of their positions, making possible a forward movement of
      the Allies, the French and British were to march east, with Lille as the
      dividing line between the two armies, the English right being directed on
      Lille.</p>

      <p>The battle which forms the chief feature of Gen. French's report
      really began on Oct. 11, when Major Gen. Gough of the Second British
      Cavalry Brigade, first came in contact with German cavalry in the woods
      along the Bethune-Aire Canal. The English cavalry moved toward
      Hazebrouck, clearing the way for two army corps, which advanced rapidly
      in a northeasterly direction. For several days the progress of the
      British was only slightly interrupted, except at La Bass&eacute;e, a high
      position, which Field Marshal French mentions as having stubbornly
      resisted.</p>

      <p>Field Marshal French says the Second Corps, under Gen. Smith-Dorrien,
      was opposed by overpowering forces of Germans, but nevertheless advanced
      until Oct. 18, when the German opposition compelled a reinforcement. Six
      days later the Lahore Division of the Indian army was sent to support the
      Second Corps.</p>

      <p>On Oct. 16 Sir Henry Rawlinson, who had covered the retreat of the
      Belgian army from Antwerp with two divisions of English cavalry and two
      divisions of French infantry, was stationed on the line east of Ypres
      under orders to operate over a wide front and to keep possession of all
      the ground held by the Allies until the First Army Corps could reach
      Ypres.</p>

      <p>Gen. Rawlinson was opposed by superior forces and was unable to
      prevent the Germans from getting large reinforcements. With four army
      corps holding a much wider front than their size justified, Field Marshal
      French says he faced a stubborn situation. The enemy was massed from the
      Lys, and there was imperative need for a strengthened line.</p>

      <p>However, the Field Marshal decided to send the First Corps north of
      Ypres to stop the reinforcements which might enable the Germans to flank
      the Allies. The shattered Belgian army and the wearied French troops'
      endeavors to check the German reinforcements were powerless, so the
      British commander sent fresh troops to prevent the Germans from executing
      movements which would have given them access to Channel ports.</p>

      <p>Sir Douglas Haig, with the First Army Corps, was sent Oct. 19 to
      capture Bruges and drive the enemy back toward Ghent, if possible.
      Meantime the Belgians intrenched themselves along the Ypres Canal. Sir
      John French commends the valor of the Belgians, who, he says, exhausted
      by weeks of constant fighting, maintained these positions gallantly.</p>

      <p>Because of the overwhelming numbers of the Germans opposing them, he
      says he enjoined a defensive r&ocirc;le upon the three army corps located
      south of Ypres. While Gen. Haig made a slight advance, Sir John says it
      was wonderful that he was able to advance at all, owing to the bad roads
      and the overwhelming number of Germans, which made it impossible to carry
      out the original plan of moving to Bruges.</p>

      <p>The fighting gradually developed into bayonet charges. Field Marshal
      French says that Oct. 21 brought forth the hardest attack, made on the
      First Corps at Ypres, in the checking of which the Worcestershire
      Regiment displayed great gallantry. This day marked the most critical
      period in the great battle, according to the Commander in Chief, who says
      the recapture of the village of Gheluvelt through a rally of the
      Worcestershires was fraught with much consequence to the Allies.</p>

      <p>After referring to some of the battles in which the Indian troops took
      part, Field Marshal French says:</p>

      <p>"Since their arrival in this country and their occupation of the line
      allotted to them I have been much impressed by the initiative and
      resource displayed by the Indian troops. Some of the ruses they have
      employed to deceive the enemy have been attended with the best results
      and have doubtless kept the superior forces in front of them at bay. Our
      Indian sappers and miners have long enjoyed a high reputation for skill
      and resource. Without going into detail I can confidently assert that
      throughout their work in this campaign they have fully justified that
      reputation.</p>

      <p>"The General officer commanding the Indian army describes the conduct
      and bearing of these troops in strange and new surroundings to have been
      highly satisfactory, and I am enabled from my own observations to fully
      corroborate this statement."</p>

      <p>Sir John French goes on to say that, while the whole line continued to
      be heavily pressed, the Germans' efforts from Nov. 1 have been
      concentrated upon breaking through the line held by the First British and
      the Ninth French Corps and thus gaining possession of the town of Ypres.
      Three Bavarian and one German corps, in addition to other troops, were
      all directed against this northern line.</p>

      <p>About Nov. 10, after several units of these corps had been completely
      shattered in futile attacks, the Field Marshal continues, a division of
      the Prussian Guard, which had been operating in the vicinity of Arras,
      was moved up to this area with great speed and secrecy. Documents found
      on dead officers, the report says, proved that the Guard received the
      German Emperor's special command to break through and succeed where their
      comrades of the line had failed. They took the leading part in the
      vigorous attacks made against the centre on the 11th and 12th, says Field
      Marshal French, but, like their comrades, were repulsed with enormous
      casualties.</p>

      <p>He pays high tribute to Sir Douglas Haig and his divisional and
      brigade commanders, who, he says, "held the line with marvelous tenacity
      and undaunted courage." The Field Marshal predicts that "their deeds
      during these days of stress and trial will furnish some of the most
      brilliant chapters which will be found in the military history of our
      time."</p>

      <p>High praise is also given the Third Cavalry Division under Major Gen.
      Julian Byng, whose troops "were repeatedly called upon to restore
      situations at critical points and fill gaps in the line caused by the
      tremendous losses which occurred."</p>

      <p>The Commander in Chief makes special mention of Col. Gordon Chesney
      Wilson of the Royal Horse Guards, Major the Hon. Hugh Dawnay of the
      Second Life Guards, and Brig. Gen. FitzClarence of the Irish Guards, who
      were killed, and of Brig. Gen. the Earl of Cavan, who "on many occasions
      was conspicuous for the skill, coolness, and courage with which he led
      his troops."</p>

      <p>Of the Flying Corps the report says:</p>

      <p>"Every day new methods of employing them, both strategically and
      tactically, are discovered and put into practice."</p>

      <p>Concerning the Territorials who have been employed, the Field Marshal
      says the conduct and bearing of these units under fire and the efficient
      manner in which they have carried out the duties assigned to them "has
      imbued me with the highest hope as to the value and the help of the
      Territorial troops generally."</p>

            reports were erroneously ascribed to Marshal French himself, and
            resulted in much admiring comment on his vivid and graphic way of

      <h3 class="two">The Battle of the Aisne Begins</h3>

      <p class="h3">[By the "Official Observer," Col. E.D. Swinton.]</p>

      <p class="right">General Headquarters,<br />
      Sept. 18, 1914.</p>

      <p>Sept. 14, the Germans were making a determined resistance along the
      River Aisne. Opposition, which it was at first thought might possibly be
      of a rear-guard nature, not entailing material delay to our progress, has
      developed and has proved to be more serious than was anticipated.</p>

      <p>The action, now being fought by the Germans along their line, may, it
      is true, have been undertaken in order to gain time for some strategic
      operation or move, and may not be their main stand. But, if this is so,
      the fighting is naturally on a scale which as to extent of ground covered
      and duration of resistance, makes it undistinguishable in its progress
      from what is known as a "pitched battle," though the enemy certainly
      showed signs of considerable disorganization during the earlier days of
      their retirement phase.</p>

      <p>Whether it was originally intended by them to defend the position they
      took up as strenuously as they have done, or whether the delay, gained
      for them during the 12th and 13th by their artillery, has enabled them to
      develop their resistance and force their line to an extent not originally
      contemplated cannot yet be said.</p>

      <p>So far as we are concerned the action still being contested is the
      battle of the Aisne. The foe we are fighting is just across the river
      along the whole of our front to the east and west. The struggle is not
      confined to the valley of that river, though it will probably bear its
      name.</p>

      <p>The progress of our operations and the French armies nearest us for
      the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th will now be described:</p>

      <p>On Monday, the 14th, those of our troops which had on the previous day
      crossed the Aisne, after driving in the German rear guards on that
      evening, found portions of the enemy's forces in prepared defensive
      positions on the right bank and could do little more than secure a
      footing north of the river. This, however, they maintained in spite of
      two counter-attacks delivered at dusk and 10 P.M., in which the fighting
      was severe.</p>

      <p>During the 14th, strong reinforcements of our troops were passed to
      the north bank, the troops crossing by ferry, by pontoon bridges, and by
      the remains of permanent bridges. Close co-operation with the French
      forces was maintained and the general progress made was good, although
      the opposition was vigorous and the state of the roads, after the heavy
      rains, made movements slow. One division alone failed to secure the
      ground it expected to.</p>

      <p>The First Army Corps, after repulsing repeated attacks, captured 600
      prisoners and twelve guns. The cavalry also took a number of prisoners.
      Many of the Germans taken belong to the reserve and Landwehr formations,
      which fact appears to indicate that the enemy is compelled to draw on
      other classes of soldiers to fill the gaps in his ranks.</p>

      <p>There was a heavy rain throughout the night of Sept. 14-15, and during
      the 15th. The situation of the British forces underwent no essential
      change. But it became more and more evident that the defensive
      preparations made by the enemy were more extensive than was at first
      apparent.</p>

      <p>In order to counterbalance these measures were taken by us to
      economize our troops and to secure protection from the hostile artillery
      fire, which was very fierce, and our men continued to improve their own
      intrenchments. The Germans bombarded our lines nearly all day, using
      heavy guns, brought, no doubt, from before Maubeuge, as well as those
      with the corps.</p>

      <p>All their counter attacks, however, failed, although in some places
      they were repeated six times. One made on the Fourth Guards Brigade was
      repulsed with heavy slaughter.</p>

      <p>An attempt to advance slightly, made by part of our line, was
      unsuccessful as regards gain of ground, but led to the withdrawal of part
      of the enemy's infantry and artillery.</p>

      <p>Further counter attacks made during the night were beaten off. Rain
      came on toward evening and continued intermittently until 9 A.M. on the
      16th.  Besides adding to the discomfort of the soldiers holding the line,
      the wet weather to some extent hampered the motor transport service,
      which was also hindered by broken bridges.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, the 16th, there was little change in the situation
      opposite the British. The efforts made by the enemy were less active than
      on the previous day, although their bombardment continued throughout the
      morning and evening. Our artillery fire drove the defenders off one of
      the salients of their position, but they returned in the evening. Forty
      prisoners were taken by the Third Division.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, the 17th, the situation, still remained unchanged in its
      essentials. The German heavy artillery fire was more active than on the
      previous day. The only infantry attacks made by the enemy were on the
      extreme right of our position, and, as had happened before, were repulsed
      with heavy loss, chiefly, on this occasion, by our field artillery.</p>

      <p>In order to convey some idea of the nature of the fighting it may be
      said that along the greater part of our front the Germans have been
      driven back from the forward slopes on the north of the river. Their
      infantry are holding strong lines of trenches among and along the edge of
      the numerous woods which crown the slopes. These trenches are elaborately
      constructed and cleverly concealed. In many places there are wire
      entanglements and lengths of rabbit fencing.</p>

      <p>Both woods and open are carefully aligned, so that they can be swept
      by rifle fire and machine guns, which are invisible from our side of the
      valley. The ground in front of the infantry trenches is also, as a rule,
      under crossfire from the field artillery placed on neighboring features
      and under high-angle fire from pieces placed well back behind the woods
      on top of the plateau.</p>

      <p>A feature of this action, as of the previous fighting, is the use by
      the enemy of their numerous heavy howitzers, with which they are able to
      direct long-range fire all over the valley and right across it. Upon
      these they evidently place great reliance.</p>

      <p>Where our men are holding the forked edges of the high ground on the
      north side they are now strongly intrenched. They are well fed, and in
      spite of the wet weather of the last week are cheerful and confident.</p>

      <p>The bombardment by both sides has been very heavy, and on Sunday,
      Monday and Tuesday was practically continuous. Nevertheless, in spite of
      the general din caused by the reports of the immense number of heavy guns
      in action along our front on Wednesday, the arrival of the French force
      acting against the German right flank was at once announced on the east
      of our front, some miles away, by the continuous roar of their
      quick-firing artillery, with which their attack was opened.</p>

      <p>So far as the British are concerned, the greater part of this week has
      been passed in bombardment, in gaining ground by degrees, and in beating
      back severe counter-attacks with heavy slaughter. Our casualties have
      been severe, but it is probable that those of the enemy are heavier.</p>

      <p>The rain has caused a great drop in the temperature, and there is more
      than a distinct feeling of Autumn in the air, especially in the early
      mornings.</p>

      <p>On our right and left the French have been fighting fiercely and have
      also been gradually gaining
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'gronud']">ground</ins>.
      One village has already during this battle been captured and re-captured
      twice by each side, and at the time of writing remains in the hands of
      the Germans.</p>

      <p>The fighting has been at close quarters and of the most desperate
      nature, and the streets of the village are filled with dead on both
      sides.</p>

      <p>As an example of the spirit which is inspiring our allies, the
      following translation of an ordre du jour, published on Sept. 9 after the
      battle of Montmirail by the commander of the French Fifth Army, is
      given:</p>

      <blockquote>
         <p>Soldiers: Upon the memorable fields of Montmirail, of Vauchamps, of
         Champaubert, which a century ago witnessed the victories of our
         ancestors over Blucher's Prussians, your vigorous offensive has
         triumphed over the resistance of the Germans. Held on his flanks, his
         centre broken, the enemy is now retreating toward the east and north
         by forced marches. The most renowned army corps of old Prussia, the
         contingents of Westphalia, of Hanover, of Brandenburg, have retired in
         haste before you.</p>

         <p>This first success is no more than the prelude. The enemy is
         shaken, but not yet decisively beaten. You have still to undergo
         severe hardships, to make long marches, to fight hard battles.</p>

         <p>May the image of our country, soiled by barbarians, always remain
         before your eyes. Never was it more necessary to sacrifice all for
         her.</p>

         <p>Saluting the heroes who have fallen in the fighting of the last few
         days, my thoughts turn toward you, the victors in the next battle.
         Forward, soldiers, for France!</p>

         <p class="signature">FRANCHET D'ESPEREY,<br />
         General Commanding the Fifth Army.<br />
         Montmirail, Sept. 9, 1914.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The Germans are a formidable enemy, well trained, long prepared, and
      brave. Their soldiers are carrying on the contest with skill and valor.
      Nevertheless they are fighting to win anyhow, regardless of all the rules
      of fair play, and there is evidence that they do not hesitate at anything
      in order to gain victory.</p>

      <p>A large number of the tales of their misbehaviors are exaggeration and
      some of the stringent precautions they have taken to guard themselves
      against the inhabitants of the areas traversed are possibly justifiable
      measures of war. But, at the same time, it has been definitely
      established that they have committed atrocities on many occasions and
      they have been guilty of brutal conduct.</p>

      <p>So many letters and statements of our wounded soldiers have been
      published in our newspapers that the following epistle from a German
      soldier of the Seventy-fourth Infantry Regiment, Tenth Corps, to his wife
      may also be of interest:</p>

      <p>"My Dear Wife: I have just been living through days that defy
      imagination. I should never have thought that men could stand it. Not a
      second has passed but my life has been in danger, and yet not a hair of
      my head has been hurt.</p>

      <p>"It was horrible! It was ghastly! but I have been saved for you and
      for our happiness, and I take heart again, although I am still terribly
      unnerved. God grant that I may see you again soon, and that this horror
      may soon be over.</p>

      <p>"None of us can do any more; human strength is at an end. I will try
      to tell you about it. On the 5th of September the enemy were reported to
      be taking up a position near St. Prix, southeast of Paris.</p>

      <p>"The Tenth Corps, which had made an astonishingly rapid advance, of
      course, was attacked on Sunday. Steep slopes led up to the heights, which
      were held in considerable force.</p>

      <p>"With our weak detachments of the Seventy-fourth and Ninety-first
      regiments we reached the crest and came under a terrible artillery fire
      that mowed us down. However, we entered St. Prix. Hardly had we done so
      than we were met with shell fire and a violent fusillade from the enemy's
      infantry.</p>

      <p>"Our Colonel was badly wounded&mdash;he is the third we have had.
      Fourteen men were killed around me. We got away in a lull without being
      hit.</p>

      <p>"The 7th, 8th, and 9th of September we were constantly under shell and
      shrapnel fire and suffered terrible losses. I was in a house which was
      hit several times. The fear of death, of agony, which is in every man's
      heart, and naturally so, is a terrible feeling.</p>

      <p>"How often I have thought of you, my darling, and what I suffered in
      that terrifying battle, which extended along a front of many miles near
      Montmirail, you cannot possibly imagine.</p>

      <p>"Our heavy artillery was being used for the siege of Maubeuge. We
      wanted it badly, as the enemy had theirs in force and kept up a furious
      bombardment. For four days I was under artillery fire. It was like hell,
      but a thousand times worse.</p>

      <p>"On the night of the 9th the order was given to retreat, as it would
      have been madness to attempt to hold our position with our few men, and
      we should have risked a terrible defeat the next day. The First and Third
      Armies had not been able to attack with us, as we had advanced too
      rapidly. Our morale was absolutely broken. In spite of unheard-of
      sacrifices we had achieved nothing.</p>

      <p>"I cannot understand how our army, after fighting three great battles
      and being terribly weakened, was sent against a position which the enemy
      had prepared for three weeks, but naturally I know nothing of the
      intentions of our Chiefs; they say nothing has been lost.</p>

      <p>"In a word, we retired toward Cormontreuil and Rheims by forced
      marches by day and night. We hear that three armies are going to get into
      line, intrench and rest, and then start afresh our victorious march on
      Paris.  It was not a defeat, only a strategic retreat. I have confidence
      in our Chiefs that everything will be successful.</p>

      <p>"Our First Battalion, which has fought with unparalleled bravery, is
      reduced from 1,200 to 194 men. These numbers speak for themselves."</p>

      <p>Among the minor happenings of interest is the following:</p>

      <p>During a counter-attack by the German Fifty-third Regiment on
      positions of the Northampton and Queen's Regiments on Thursday, the 17th,
      a force of some 400 of the enemy were allowed to approach right up to the
      trench occupied by a platoon of the former regiment, owing to the fact
      that they had held up their hands and made gestures that were interpreted
      as signs that they wished to surrender. When they were actually on the
      parapet of the trench held, by the Northamptons they opened fire on our
      men at point-blank range.</p>

      <p>Unluckily for the enemy, however, flanking them and only some 400
      yards away, there happened to be a machine gun manned by a detachment of
      the Queen's. This at once opened fire, cutting a lane through their mass,
      and they fell back to their own trench with great loss. Shortly afterward
      they were driven further back, with additional loss, by a battalion of
      Guards which came up in support.</p>

      <p>An incident, which occurred some little time ago during our
      retirement, is also worthy of record. On Aug. 28, during the battle
      fought by the French along the Oise between La Fere and Guise, one of the
      French commanders desired to make an air reconnoissance. It was found,
      however, that no observers were available.</p>

      <p>Wishing to help our allies as much as possible a British officer
      attached to this particular French army volunteered to go up with the
      pilot to observe. He had never been in an aeroplane, but he made the
      ascent and produced a valuable reconnoissance report.</p>

      <p>Incidentally he had a duel in the air at an altitude of 6,000 feet
      with the observer of a German Taube monoplane which approached. He fired
      several shots and drove off the hostile aeroplane. His action was much
      appreciated by the French.</p>

      <p>In view of the many statements made in the press as to the use of
      Zeppelins against us, it is interesting to note that the Royal Flying
      Corps, who had been out on reconnoissance every day since their arrival
      in France, have never seen a Zeppelin, though airships of a non-rigid
      type have been seen on two occasions near Marne.</p>

      <p>Late one evening two such were observed over the German forces. An
      aeroplane was dispatched against them, but in the darkness our pilots
      were uncertain of the airship's nationality and did not attack. It was
      afterward made clear that they could not have been French.</p>

      <p>A week later an officer, reconnoitring to the flank, saw an airship
      over the German forces and opposite the French. It had no distinguishing
      mark and was assumed to belong to the latter, though it is now known that
      it also must have been a German craft.</p>

      <p>The orders of the Royal Flying Corps are to attack Zeppelins at once,
      and there is some disappointment at the absence of those targets.</p>

      <p>The following special order has been issued today to the troops:</p>

      <blockquote>
         <p class="center">"Special Order of the Day,<br />
         By Field Marshal Sir John French,<br />
         G.C.B., G.C.V.O., K.C.M.G.,<br />
         Commander in Chief of the British Army in the Field.</p>

         <p class="right">"September 17, 1914.</p>

         <p>"Once more I have to express my deep appreciation of the splendid
         behavior of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the
         army under my command throughout the great battle of the Aisne, which
         has been in progress since the evening of the 12th inst., and the
         battle of the Marne, which lasted from the morning of the 6th to the
         evening of the 10th and finally ended in the precipitate flight of the
         enemy.</p>

         <p>"When we were brought face to face with a position of extraordinary
         strength, carefully intrenched and prepared for defense by an army and
         staff which are thorough adepts in such work, throughout the 13th and
         14th, that position was most gallantly attacked by the British forces
         and the passage of the Aisne effected. This is the third day the
         troops have been gallantly holding the position they have gained
         against most desperate counter-attacks and the hail of heavy
         artillery.</p>

         <p>"I am unable to find adequately words in which to express the
         admiration I feel for their magnificent conduct.</p>

         <p>"The French armies on our right and left are making good progress,
         and I feel sure that we have only to hold on with tenacity to the
         ground we have won for a very short time longer when the Allies will
         be again in full pursuit of a beaten enemy.</p>

         <p>"The self-sacrificing devotion and splendid spirit of the British
         army in France will carry all before it.</p>

      <h3 class="one">II.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">The Slow Fight on the Aisne.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Made Public Sept. 24.]</p>

      <p>The enemy is still maintaining himself along the whole front, and, in
      order to do so, is throwing into the fight detachments composed of units
      from different formations, the active army, reserve, and Landwehr, as is
      shown by the uniforms of the prisoners recently captured.</p>

      <p>Our progress, although slow on account of the strength of the
      defensive positions against which we are pressing, has in certain
      directions been continuous; but the present battle may well last for some
      days more before a decision is reached, since it now approximates
      somewhat to siege warfare.</p>

      <p>The Germans are making use of searchlights. This fact, coupled with
      their great strength in heavy artillery, leads to the supposition that
      they are employing material which may have been collected for the siege
      of Paris.</p>

      <p>The nature of the general situation after the operations of the 18th,
      19th, and 20th cannot better be summarized than as expressed recently by
      a neighboring French commander to his corps: "Having repulsed repeated
      and violent counter-attacks made by the enemy, we have a feeling that we
      have been victorious."</p>

      <p>So far as the British are concerned, the course of events during these
      three days can be described in a few words. During Friday, the 18th,
      artillery fire was kept up intermittently by both sides during daylight.
      At night the German centre attacked certain portions of our line,
      supporting the advance of their infantry, as always, by a heavy
      bombardment. But the strokes were not delivered with great vigor, and
      ceased about 2 A.M. During the day's fighting an aircraft gun of the
      Third Army Corps succeeded in bringing down a German aeroplane.</p>

      <p>News also was received that a body of French cavalry had demolished
      part of the railway to the north, so cutting, at least temporarily, one
      line of communication which is of particular importance to the enemy.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, the 19th, the bombardment was resumed by the Germans at
      an early hour and continued intermittently under reply from our own guns.
      Some of their infantry advanced from cover, apparently with the intention
      of attacking, but on coming under fire they retired. Otherwise the day
      was uneventful, except for the activity of the artillery, which is a
      matter of normal routine rather than an event.</p>

      <p>Another hostile aeroplane was brought down by us, and one of our
      aviators succeeded in dropping several bombs over the German line, one
      incendiary bomb falling with considerable effect on a transport park near
      La F&egrave;re.</p>

      <p>A buried store of the enemy's munitions of war was also found, not far
      from the Aisne, ten wagon loads of live shell and two wagon loads of
      cable being dug up. Traces were discovered of large quantities of stores
      having been burned&mdash;all tending to show that as far back as the
      Aisne the German retirement was hurried.</p>

      <p>There was a strong wind during the day, accompanied by a driving rain.
      This militated against the aerial reconnoissance.</p>

      <p>On Sunday, the 20th, nothing of importance occurred until the
      afternoon, when there was a break in the clouds and an interval of feeble
      sunshine, which was hardly powerful enough to warm the soaking troops.
      The Germans took advantage of this brief spell of fine weather to make
      several counter-attacks against different points. These were all repulsed
      with loss to the enemy, but the casualties incurred by us were by no
      means light.</p>

      <p>In one section of our firing line the occupants of the trenches were
      under the impression that they heard a military band in the enemy's lines
      just before the attack developed. It is now known that the German
      infantry started their advance with bands playing.</p>

      <p>The offensive against one or two points was renewed at dusk, with no
      greater success. The brunt of the resistance has naturally fallen upon
      the infantry. In spite of the fact that they have been drenched to the
      skin for some days and their trenches have been deep in mud and water,
      and in spite of the incessant night alarms and the almost continuous
      bombardment to which they have been subjected, they have on every
      occasion been ready for the enemy's infantry when the latter attempted to
      assault, and they have beaten them back with great loss. Indeed, the
      sight of the Pickelhauben [German spiked helmets] coming up has been a
      positive relief after long, trying hours of inaction under shell
      fire.</p>

      <p>The object of the great proportion of artillery the Germans employ is
      to beat down the resistance of their enemy by concentrated and prolonged
      fire, to shatter their nerves with high explosives, before the infantry
      attack is launched. They seem to have relied on doing this with us, but
      they have not done so, though it has taken them several costly
      experiments to discover this fact.</p>

      <p>From statements of prisoners it appears that they have been greatly
      disappointed by the moral effect produced by their heavy guns, which,
      despite the actual losses inflicted, has not been at all commensurate
      with the colossal expenditure of ammunition, which has really been
      wasted. By this it is not implied that their artillery fire is not good;
      it is more than good&mdash;it is excellent. But the British soldier is a
      difficult person to impress or depress, even by immense shells filled
      with a high explosive which detonate with terrific violence and form
      craters large enough to act as graves for five horses.</p>

      <p>The German howitzer shells are from 8 to 9 inches in calibre, and on
      impact they send up columns of greasy black smoke. On account of this
      they are irreverently dubbed "coal boxes," "black Marias," or "Jack
      Johnsons" by the soldiers. Men who take things in this spirit are, it
      seems, likely to throw out the calculations based on the loss of morale
      so carefully framed by the German military philosophers.</p>

      <p>A considerable amount of information has been gleaned from prisoners.
      It has been gathered that our bombardment on the 15th produced a great
      impression. The opinion is also reported that our infantry make such good
      use of ground that the German companies are decimated by our rifle fire
      before the British soldier can be seen.</p>

      <p>From an official diary captured by the First Army Corps it appears
      that one of the German corps contains an extraordinary mixture of units.
      If the composition of the other corps is similar, it may be assumed that
      the present efficiency of the enemy's forces is in no way comparable with
      what it was when the war commenced.</p>

      <p>The losses in officers are noted as having been especially severe. A
      brigade is stated to be commanded by a Major; some companies of food
      guards by one-year volunteers; while after the battle of Montmirail one
      regiment lost fifty-five out of sixty officers. The prisoners recently
      captured appreciate the fact that the march on Paris has failed and that
      their forces are retreating, but state that the object of this movement
      is explained by the officers as being to withdraw into closer touch with
      the supports, which have stayed too far in the rear.</p>

      <p>The officers are also endeavoring to encourage the troops by telling
      them that they will be at home by Christmas. A large number of the men
      believe that they are beaten. Following is an extract from one
      document:</p>

      <p>"With the English troops we have great difficulties. They have a queer
      way of causing losses to the enemy. They make good trenches, in which
      they wait patiently; they carefully measure the ranges for their rifle
      fire, and they open a truly hellish fire on the unsuspecting cavalry.
      This was the reason that we had such heavy losses.</p>

      <p>"According to our officers, the English striking forces are exhausted;
      the English people really never wanted war."</p>

      <p>From another source: "The English are very brave and fight to the last
      man. One of our companies has lost 130 men out of 240."</p>

      <p>The following letter, which refers to the fighting on the Aisne, has
      been printed and circulated to the troops:</p>

      <blockquote>
         <p class="center"><span class="pscaps">Letter Found on German Officer of Seventh Reserve
            Corps</span>:</p>

         <p class="right">Cerny, South of Laon, Sept 14, 1914.</p>

         <p>My Dear Parents: Our corps has the task of holding the heights
         south of Cerny in all circumstances until the Fourteenth Corps on our
         left flank can grip the enemy's flank. On our right are other corps.
         We are fighting with the English Guards, Highlanders, and Zouaves. The
         losses on both sides have been enormous. For the most part this is due
         to the too brilliant French artillery.</p>

         <p>The English are marvelously trained in making use of ground. One
         never sees them, and one is constantly under fire. The French airmen
         perform wonderful feats. We cannot get rid of them. As soon as an
         airman has flown over us, ten minutes later we get their shrapnel fire
         in our positions. We have little artillery in our corps; without it we
         cannot get forward.</p>

         <p>Three days ago our division took possession of these heights and
         dug itself in. Two days ago, early in the morning, we were attacked by
         an immensely superior English force, one brigade and two battalions,
         and were turned out of our positions. The fellows took five guns from
         us. It was a tremendous hand-to-hand fight.</p>

         <p>How I escaped myself I am not clear. I then had to bring up
         supports on foot. My horse was wounded, and the others were too far in
         the rear. Then came up the Guards Jager Battalion, Fourth Jager, Sixth
         Regiment, Reserve Regiment Thirteen, and Landwehr Regiments Thirteen
         and Sixteen, and with the help of the artillery we drove the fellows
         out of the position again. Our machine guns did excellent work; the
         English fell in heaps.</p>

         <p>In our battalion three Iron Crosses have been given, one to C.O.,
         one to Capt. &mdash;&mdash;, and one to Surgeon &mdash;&mdash;. [Names
         probably deleted.] Let us hope that we shall be the lucky ones next
         time.</p>

         <p>During the first two days of the battle I had only one piece of
         bread and no water. I spent the night in the rain without my overcoat.
         The rest of my kit was on the horses which had been left behind with
         the baggage and which cannot come up into the battle because as soon
         as you put your nose up from behind cover the bullets whistle.</p>

         <p>War is terrible. We are all hoping that a decisive battle will end
         the war, as our troops already have got round Paris. If we beat the
         English the French resistance will soon be broken. Russia will be very
         quickly dealt with; of this there is no doubt.</p>

         <p>We received splendid help from the
         <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'Austrain']">Austrian</ins>
         heavy artillery at Maubeuge. They bombarded Fort Cerfontaine in such a
         way that there was not ten meters a parapet which did not show
         enormous craters made by the shells. The armored turrets were found
         upside down.</p>

         <p>Yesterday evening, about 6, in the valley in which our reserves
         stood there was such a terrible cannonade that we saw nothing of the
         sky but a cloud of smoke. We had few casualties.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Recently a pilot and observer of the Royal Flying Corps were forced by
      a breakage in their aeroplane to descend in the enemy's lines. The pilot
      managed to pancake his machine down to earth, and the two escaped into
      some thick under-growth in the woods.</p>

      <p>The enemy came up and seized and smashed the machine, but did not
      search for our men with much zeal. The latter lay hid till dark and then
      found their way to the Aisne, across which they swam, reaching camp in
      safety, but barefooted.</p>

      <p>Numerous floating bridges have been thrown across the Aisne and some
      of the pontoon bridges have been repaired under fire. On the 20th, Lieut.
      [name deleted] of the Third Signal Corps, Royal Engineers, was
      unfortunately drowned while attempting to swim across the river with a
      cable in order to open up fresh telegraphic communication on the north
      side.</p>

      <p>Espionage is still carried on by the enemy to a considerable extent.
      Recently the suspicions of some of the French troops were aroused by
      coming across a farm from which the horses had been removed. After some
      search they discovered a telephone which was connected by an underground
      cable with the German lines, and the owner of the farm paid the penalty
      in the usual way in war for his treachery.</p>

      <p>After some cases of village fighting which occurred earlier in the war
      it was reported by some of our officers that the Germans had attempted to
      approach to close quarters by forcing prisoners to march in front of
      them. The Germans have recently repeated the same trick on a larger scale
      against the French, as is shown by the copy of an order printed below. It
      is therein referred to as a ruse, but, if that term can be accepted, a
      distinctly illegal ruse.</p>

      <p>"During a recent night attack," the order reads, "the Germans drove a
      column of French prisoners in front of them. This action is to be brought
      to the notice of all our troops (1) in order to put them on their guard
      against such a dastardly ruse; (2) in order that every soldier may know
      how the Germans treat their prisoners. Our troops must not forget if they
      allow themselves to be taken prisoners the Germans will not fail to
      expose them to French bullets."</p>

      <p>Further evidence has now been collected of the misuse of the white
      flag and other signs of surrender. During an action on the 17th, owing to
      this, one officer was shot. During recent fighting, also, some German
      ambulance wagons advanced in order to collect the wounded. An order to
      cease firing was consequently given to our guns, which were firing on
      this particular section of ground. The German battery commanders at once
      took advantage of the lull in the action to climb up their observation
      ladders and on to a haystack to locate our guns, which soon afterward
      came under a far more accurate fire than any to which they had been
      subjected up to that time.</p>

      <p>A British officer, who was captured by the Germans and has since
      escaped, reports that while a prisoner he saw men who had been fighting
      subsequently put on Red Cross brassards.</p>

      <p>That irregular use of the protection afforded by the Geneva Convention
      is not uncommon is confirmed by the fact that on one occasion men in the
      uniform of combatant units have been captured wearing a Red Cross
      brassard hastily slipped over the arm. The excuse given has been that
      they had been detailed after the fight to look after the wounded.</p>

      <p>It is reported by a cavalry officer that the driver of a motor car
      with a machine gun mounted on it, which was captured, was wearing a Red
      Cross.</p>

      <p>Full details of the actual damage done to the cathedral at Rheims will
      doubtless have been cabled home, so that no description of it is
      necessary. The Germans bombarded the cathedral twice with their heavy
      artillery.</p>

      <p>One reason it caught alight so quickly was that on one side of it was
      some scaffolding which had been erected for restoration work. Straw had
      also been laid on the floor for the reception of the German wounded. It
      is to the credit of the French that practically all the German wounded
      were successfully extricated from the burning building.</p>

      <p>There was no justification on military grounds for this act of
      vandalism, which seems to have been caused by exasperation born of
      failure&mdash;a sign of impotence rather than strength. It is noteworthy
      that a well-known hotel not far from the cathedral, which was kept by a
      German, was not touched.</p>


      <h3 class="one">III.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">Two September Days.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Made Public Sept. 28.]</p>

      <p>For four days there has been a comparative lull all along our front.
      This has been
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'acompanied']">accompanied</ins>
      by a spell of fine weather, though the nights have been much colder. One
      cannot have everything, however, and one evil result of the sunshine has
      been the release of flies, which were torpid during the wet days.</p>

      <p>Advantage has been taken of the arrival of reinforcements to relieve
      by fresh troops the men who have been on the firing line for some time.
      Several units, therefore, have received their baptism of fire during the
      week.</p>

      <p>Since the last letter left headquarters evidence has been received
      which points to the fact that during the counter attacks on the night of
      Sept.  20 German detachments of infantry fired into each other. This was
      the result of an attempt to carry out the dangerous expedient of a
      converging advance in the dark. Opposite one portion of our position
      considerable massing of hostile forces was observed before dark. Some
      hours later a furious
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'fusilade']">fusillade</ins>
      was heard in front of our line, though no bullets came over our
      trenches.</p>

      <p>This narrative begins with Sept. 21 and covers only two days. There
      was but little rain on Sept. 21 and the weather took a turn for the
      better, which has been maintained. The action has been practically
      confined to the artillery, our guns at one point shelling and driving the
      enemy, who endeavored to construct a redoubt.</p>

      <p>The Germans expended a large number of heavy shells in a long range
      bombardment of the village of Missy (Department of the Aisne).
      Reconnoitring parties sent out during the night of Sept. 21-22 discovered
      some deserted trenches. In them or in the woods over 100 dead and wounded
      were picked up. A number of rifles, ammunition and equipment were also
      found. There were other signs that portions of the enemy's forces had
      withdrawn some distance.</p>

      <p>The weather was also fine on Sept. 22 with less wind, and it was one
      of the most uneventful days we have passed since we reached the Aisne,
      that is, uneventful for the British. There was less artillery work on
      either side, the Germans giving the village of Paissy (Aisne) a taste of
      the "Jack Johnsons." The spot thus honored is not far from the ridge
      where there has been some of the most severe close fighting in which we
      have taken part. All over this No Man's Land, between the lines, bodies
      of German infantrymen were still lying in heaps where they had fallen at
      different times.</p>

      <p>Espionage plays so large a part in the conduct of the war by the
      Germans that it is difficult to avoid further reference to the subject.
      They have evidently never forgotten the saying of Frederick the Great:
      "When Marshall Soubise goes to war he is followed by a hundred cooks.
      When I take the field I am preceded by a hundred spies." Indeed until
      about twenty years ago there was a paragraph in their field service
      regulations directing that the service of protection in the field, such
      as outposts and advance guards, should always be supplemented by a system
      of espionage. Although such instructions are no longer made public the
      Germans, as is well known, still carry them into effect.</p>

      <p>Apart from the more elaborate arrangements which were made in peace
      time for obtaining information by paid agents some of the methods which
      are being employed for the collection or conveyance of intelligence are
      as follows:</p>

      <p>Men in plain clothes signal the German lines from points in the hands
      of the enemy by means of colored lights at nights and puffs of smoke from
      chimneys in the day time. Pseudo laborers working in the fields between
      the armies have been detected conveying information. Persons in plain
      clothes have acted as advanced scouts to the German cavalry when
      advancing.</p>

      <p>German officers or soldiers in plain clothes or French or British
      uniforms have remained in localities evacuated by the Germans in order to
      furnish them with intelligence. One spy of this kind was found by our
      troops hidden in a church tower. His presence was only discovered through
      the erratic movements of the hands of the church clock, which he was
      using to signal his friends by an improvised semaphore code. Had this man
      not been seized it is probable he would have signalled the time of
      arrival and the exact position of the headquarters staff of the force and
      a high explosive shell would then have mysteriously dropped on the
      building.</p>

      <p>Women spies have also been caught. Secret agents have been found at
      rail heads observing entrainments and detrainments. It is a simple matter
      for spies to mix with refugees who are moving about to and from their
      homes, and it is difficult for our troops, who speak neither French nor
      German, to detect them. The French have also found it necessary to search
      villages and casual wayfarers on the roads and to search for carrier
      pigeons.</p>

      <p>Among the precautions taken by us against spying is the following
      notice printed in French, posted up:</p>

      <blockquote>
         <p>"Motor cars and bicycles other than those; carrying soldiers in
         uniform may not circulate on the roads. Inhabitants may not leave the
         localities in which they reside between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M.  Inhabitants
         may not quit their homes after 8 P.M. No person may on any pretext
         pass through the British lines without an authorization countersigned

      <p>Events have moved so quietly for the last two months that anything
      connected with the mobilization of the British expeditionary force is now
      ancient history. Nevertheless, the following extract from a German order
      is evidence of the mystification of the army and a tribute to the value
      of the secrecy which was so well and so loyally maintained in England at

      <h3 class="two">Fighting in the Air.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Made Public Sept. 29.]</p>

      <p>Wednesday, Sept. 23, was a perfect Autumn day. It passed without
      incident as regards major operations. Although the enemy concentrated
      their heavy artillery upon the, plateau near Passy, nothing more than
      inconvenience was caused.</p>

      <p>The welcome absence of wind gave our airmen a chance of which they
      took full advantage by gathering much information. Unfortunately, one of
      our aviators, who had been particularly active in annoying the enemy by
      dropping bombs, was wounded in a duel in the air.</p>

      <p>Being alone on a single-seated monoplane, he was not able to use his
      rifle, and while circling above a German two-seated machine in an
      endeavor to get within pistol shot he was hit by the observer of the
      German machine, who was armed with a rifle. He managed to fly back over
      our lines, and by great good luck he descended close to a motor
      ambulance, which at once conveyed him to a hospital.</p>

      <p>Against this may be set off the fact that another of our flyers
      exploded a bomb among some led artillery horses, killing several and
      stampeding the others.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Sept. 21, the fine weather continued, as did the lull in
      the action, the heavy German shells falling mostly near Pargnan, twelve
      miles south-southeast of Laon.</p>

      <p>On both Wednesday and Thursday the weather was so fine that many
      flights were made by the aviators, French, British, and German. These
      produced a corresponding activity among the anti-aircraft guns.</p>

      <p>So still and clear was the atmosphere toward evening on Wednesday and
      during the whole of Thursday that to those not especially on the lookout
      the presence of aeroplanes high up above them was first made known by the
      bursting of the projectiles aimed at them. The puffs of smoke from the
      detonation shell hung in the air for minutes on end, like balls of fleece
      cotton, before they slowly expanded and were dissipated.</p>

      <p>From the places mentioned as being the chief targets for the enemy's
      heavy howitzers, it will be seen that the Germans are not inclined to
      concentrate their fire systematically upon definite areas in which their
      aviators think they have located our guns, or upon villages where it is
      imagined our troops may be billeted. The result will be to give work to
      local builders.</p>

      <p>The growing resemblance of this battle to siege warfare has already
      been pointed out. The fact that the later actions of the Russo-Japanese
      war assumed a similar character was thought by many to have been due to
      exceptional causes, such as the narrowness of the theatre of operations
      between the Chinese frontier on the west and the mountainous country of
      Northern Korea on the east; the lack of roads, which limited the extent
      of ground over which it was possible for the rival armies to manoeuvre,
      and the fact that both forces were tied to one line of railroad.</p>

      <p>Such factors are not exerting any influence on the present battle.
      Nevertheless, a similar situation has been produced, owing firstly to the
      immense power of resistance possessed by an army which is amply equipped
      with heavy artillery and has sufficient time to fortify itself, and,
      secondly, to the vast size of the forces engaged, which at the present
      time stretch more than half way across France.</p>

      <p>The extent of the country covered is so great as to render slow any
      efforts to manoeuvre and march around to a flank in order to escape the
      costly expedient of a frontal attack against heavily fortified
      positions.</p>

      <p>To state that the methods of attack must approximate more closely to
      those of siege warfare the greater the resemblance of the defenses to
      those of a fortress is a platitude, but it is one which will bear
      repetition if it in any way assists to make the present situation
      clear.</p>

      <p>There is no doubt that the position on the Aisne was not hastily
      selected by the German Staff after the retreat had begun. From the choice
      of ground, and the care with which the fields of fire had been arranged
      to cover all possible avenues of approach, and from the amount of work
      already carried out, it is clear that the contingency of having to act on
      the defensive was not overlooked when the details of the strategically
      offensive campaign were arranged.</p>

      <p class="h3">[Made Public Oct. 9.]</p>

      <p>Wednesday, Sept. 30, merely marked another day's progress in the
      gradual development of the situation, and was distinguished by no
      activity beyond slight attacks by the enemy. There was also artillery
      fire at intervals. One of our airmen succeeded in dropping nine bombs,
      some of which fell on the enemy's rolling stock collected on the railway
      near Laon. Some of the enemy's front trenches were found empty at night;
      but nothing much can be deduced from this fact, for they are frequently
      evacuated in this way, no doubt to prevent the men in the back lines
      firing on their comrades in front of them.</p>

      <p>Thursday, Oct. 1, was a most perfect Autumn day, and the most peaceful
      that there has been since the two forces engaged on the Aisne. There was
      only desultory gunfire as targets offered. During the night the enemy
      made a few new trenches. A French aviator dropped one bomb on a railway
      station and three bombs on troops massed near it.</p>

      <p>The weather on Friday, the 2d, was very misty in the early hours, and
      it continued hazy until the late afternoon, becoming thicker again at
      night. The Germans were driven out of a mill which they had occupied as
      an advanced post, their guns and machine guns which supported it being
      knocked out one by one by well-directed artillery fire from a flank.
      During the night they made the usual two attacks on the customary spot in
      our lines, and as on previous occasions were repulsed. Two of their
      trenches were captured and filled in. Our loss was six men wounded.</p>

      <p>Up to Sept, 21 the air mileage made by our airmen since the beginning
      of the war amounted to 87,000 miles, an average of 2,000 miles per day,
      the total equaling nearly four times the circuit of the world. The total
      time spent in the air was 1,400 hours.</p>

      <p>There are many points connected with the fighting methods of either
      side that may be of interest. The following description was given by a
      battalion commander who has been at the front since the commencement of
      hostilities and has fought both in the open and behind intrenchments. It
      must, however, be borne in mind that it only represents the experiences
      of a particular unit. It deals with the tactics of the enemy's
      infantry:</p>

      <blockquote>
         <p>The important points to watch are the heads of valleys and ravines,
         woods&mdash;especially those on the sides of hollow ground&mdash;and
         all dead ground to the front and flanks. The German officers are
         skilled in leading troops forward under cover, in closed bodies, but
         once the latter are deployed and there is no longer direct personal
         leadership the men will not face heavy fire. Sometimes the advance is
         made in a series of lines, with the men well opened out at five or six
         paces interval; at other times it is made in a line, with the men
         almost shoulder to shoulder, followed in all cases by supports in
         close formation. The latter either waver when the front line is
         checked, or crowd on to it, moving forward under the orders of their
         officers, and the mass forms a magnificent target.  Prisoners have
         described the fire of our troops as pinning them to the ground, and
         this is certainly borne out by their action.</p>

         <p>When the Germans are not heavily intrenched no great losses are
         incurred in advancing against them by the methods in which the British
         Army has been instructed. For instance, in one attack over fairly open
         ground against about an equal force of infantry sheltered in a sunken
         road and in ditches we lost only 10 killed and 60 wounded, while over
         400 of the enemy surrendered after about 50 had been killed. Each side
         had the support of a battery, but the fight for superiority from
         infantry fire took place at about 700 yards and lasted only half an
         hour. When the Germans were wavering some of them put up the white
         flag, but others went on firing, and our men continued to do the same.
         Eventually a large number of white flags, improvised from
         handkerchiefs, pieces of shirt, white biscuit bags, &amp;c., were
         exhibited all along the line, and many men hoisted their helmets on
         their rifles.</p>

         <p>In the fighting behind intrenchments the Germans endeavor to gain
         ground by making advances in line at dusk or just before dawn, and
         then digging themselves in, in the hope, no doubt, that they may
         eventually get so near as to be able, as at manoeuvres, to reach the
         hostile trenches in a single rush. They have never succeeded in doing
         this against us. If by creeping up in dead ground they do succeed in
         gaining ground by night, they are easily driven back by fire in the
         morning. A few of the braver men sometimes remain behind, at ranges of
         even 300 or 400 yards, and endeavor to inflict losses by sniping.
         Sharpshooters, also, are often noticed in trees or wriggling about
         until they get good cover. The remedy is to take the initiative and
         detail men to deal with the enemy's sharpshooters.</p>

         <p>A few night attacks have been made against us. Before one of them a
         party crept up close to the British line and set alight a hayrick, so
         that it should form a beacon on which the centre of the attacking line
         marched. Generally, however, in the night and early morning attacks,
         groups of forty or fifty men have come on, the groups sometimes widely
         separated from one another and making every endeavor to obtain any
         advantage from cover. Light balls and searchlights have on some
         occasions been used. Latterly the attacks have become more and more
         half-hearted. Against us the enemy has never closed with the bayonet.
         The German trenches I have seen were deep enough to shelter a man when
         firing standing, and had a step down in rear for the supports to sit
         in.</p>

         <p>As regards our own men, there was at first considerable reluctance
         to intrench, as has always been the case at the commencement of a war.
         Now, however, having bought experience dearly, their defenses are such
         that they can defy the German artillery fire.</p>

      <h3 class="one">VI.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">Becomes an Artillery Duel.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Made Public Oct. 10.]</p>

      <p>Comparative calm on our front has continued through the fine and
      considerably warmer weather. The last six days have been slightly misty
      with clouds hanging low, so that conditions have not been very favorable
      for aerial reconnoissance.</p>

      <p>In regard to the latter, it is astonishing how quickly the habit is
      acquired, even by those who are not aviators, of thinking of the weather
      in terms of its suitability for flying. There has been a bright moon
      also, which has militated against night attacks.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, Oct. 3, practically nothing happened, except that each
      side shelled the other.</p>

      <p>Toward evening on Sunday, Oct. 4, there was a similar absence of
      activity. Opposite one portion of our line the enemy's bands played
      patriotic airs, and the audiences which gathered gave a chance to our
      waiting howitzers.</p>

      <p>Not only do their regimental bands perform occasionally, but with
      their proverbial fondness for music the Germans have in some places
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'gramaphones']">gramophones</ins>
      in their trenches.</p>

      <p>On Monday, the 5th, there were three separate duels in the air between
      French and German aviators, one of which was visible from our trenches.
      Two of the struggles were, so far as could be seen, indecisive, but in
      the third the French airmen were victorious, and brought down their
      opponents, both of whom were killed by machine gun fire. The observer was
      so burned as to be unrecognizable.</p>

      <p>During the day some men of the Landwehr were taken prisoners by us.
      They were in very poor condition and wept copiously when captured. One,
      on being asked what he was crying for, explained that though they had
      been advised to surrender to the English, they believed that they would
      be shot.</p>

      <p>On that evening our airmen had an unusual amount of attention paid to
      them, both by the German aviators and their artillery of every
      description.</p>

      <p>One of our infantry patrols discovered 150 dead Germans in a wood, one
      and a half miles from our front. We sent a party out to bury them, but it
      was fired upon and had to withdraw.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, the 6th, the enemy's guns were active in the afternoon. It
      is believed that the bombardment was due to anger because two of our
      howitzer shells had detonated right in one of the enemy's trenches, which
      was full of men. Three horses were killed by the German fire.</p>

      <p>Wednesday, the 7th, was uneventful.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, the 8th, the shelling by the enemy of a locality on our
      front, which has so far been the scene of their greatest efforts, was
      again continuous. Opposite one or two points the Germans have attempted
      to gain ground by sapping in some places with the view of secretly
      pushing forward machine guns in advance of their trenches, so that they
      can suddenly sweep with crossfire the space between our line and theirs,
      and so take any advance of ours on the flank.</p>

      <p>It is reported that at one point where the French were much annoyed by
      the fire of a German machine gun, which was otherwise inaccessible, they
      drove a mine gallery, 50 meters (about 164 feet) long, up to and under
      the emplacement, and blew up the gun. The man who drove the gallery
      belonged to a corps which was recruited in one of the coal-mining
      districts of France.</p>

      <p>The German machine guns are mounted on low sledges, and are
      inconspicuous and evidently easily moved.</p>

      <p>The fighting now consists mostly of shelling by the artillery of both
      sides and in front a line of fire from the machine guns as an occasional
      target offers. Our Maxims have been doing excellent work and have proved
      most efficient weapons for the sort of fighting in which we are now
      engaged.</p>

      <p>At times there are so many outbursts of their fire in different
      directions that it is possible for an expert to tell by comparison which
      of the guns have their springs adjusted and are well tuned up for the
      day. The amount of practice that our officers are now getting in the use
      of this weapon is proving most valuable in teaching them how to maintain
      it at concert pitch as an instrument and how to derive the best tactical
      results from its employment.</p>

      <p>Against us the Germans are not now expending so much gun ammunition as
      they have been, but they continue to fire at insignificant targets. They
      have the habit of suddenly dropping heavy shells without warning in
      localities of villages far behind our front line, possibly on the chance
      of catching some of our troops in bivouac or billets. They also fire a
      few rounds at night.</p>

      <p>The artillery has up to now played so great a part in the war that a
      few general remarks descriptive of the methods of its employment by the
      enemy are justified. Their field artillery armament consists of
      15-pounder quick-fire guns for horse and field batteries of divisions and
      there are, in addition, with each corps three to six batteries of
      4.3-inch field howitzers and about two batteries of 5.9-inch howitzers.
      With an army there are some 8.2-inch heavy howitzers.</p>

      <p>The accuracy of their fire is apt at first to cause some alarm, more
      especially as the guns are usually well concealed and the position and
      the direction from which the fire is proceeding are difficult of
      detection. But accurate as is their shooting, the German gunners have on
      the whole had little luck, and during the past three weeks an
      astonishingly small proportion of the number of shells fired by them have
      been really effective.</p>

      <p>Quite the most striking feature of their handling of the artillery is
      the speed with which they concentrate the fire upon any selected point.
      They dispense to a great extent with the method of ranging known by us as
      bracketing, especially when acting on the defensive, and direct their
      fire by means of squared maps and the telephone. Thus, when the target is
      found, its position on the map is telephoned to such batteries as it is
      desired to employ against that particular square.</p>

      <p>In addition to the guns employed to fire on the targets as they are
      picked up, others are told off to watch particular roads, and to deal
      with any of the enemy using them.</p>

      <p>Both for the location of targets and the communication of the effect
      of the fire, reliance is placed on observation from aeroplanes and
      balloons and on information supplied by special observers and secret
      agents, who are sent out ahead or left behind in the enemy's lines to
      communicate by telephone or signal. These observers have been found in
      haystacks, barns, and other buildings well in advance of the German
      lines.  Balloons of the so-called sausage pattern remain up in the air
      for long periods for the purpose of discovering targets, and until our
      aviators made their influence felt by chasing all hostile aeroplanes on
      sight the latter were continually hovering over our troops in order to
      register their positions and to note where the headquarters, reserves,
      gun teams, &amp;c., were located.</p>

      <p>If suitable targets are discovered the airman drops a smoke ball
      directly over it or lets fall some strips of tinsel, which glitter in the
      sun as they slowly descend to the earth. The range to the target is
      apparently ascertained by those near the guns by a large telemeter, or
      other range finder, which is kept trained on the aeroplane, so that when
      the signal is made the distance to the target vertically below is at once
      obtained. A few rounds are then fired, and the result is signalled back
      by the aviator according to some prearranged code.</p>


      <h3 class="one">VII.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">A Fight in the Clouds.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Dated Oct. 13.]</p>

      <p>From Friday the 9th of October until Monday the 12th so little
      occurred that a narrative of the events can be given in a few words.
      There has been the usual sporadic shelling of our trenches which has
      resulted in but little harm, so well dug in are our men, and on the night
      of the 10th the Germans made yet a fresh assault, supported by artillery
      fire, against the point which has all along attracted most of their
      attention.</p>

      <p>The attempt was again a costly failure toward which our guns were able
      to contribute with great effect.</p>

      <p>Details have been received of an exciting encounter in midair. One of
      our aviators on a fast scouting monoplane sighted a hostile machine. He
      had two rifles, fixed one on either side of his engines, and at once gave
      chase, but lost sight of his opponent among the clouds. Soon, however,
      another machine hove into view which turned out to be a German Otto
      biplane, a type of machine which is not nearly so fast as our scouts. Our
      officer once again started a pursuit. He knew that owing to the position
      of the propeller of the hostile machine he could not be fired at when
      astern of his opponent. At sixty yards range he fired one rifle without
      apparent result. Then as his pace was carrying him ahead of his quarry he
      turned round, and, again coming to about the same distance behind,
      emptied his magazine at the German.</p>

      <p>The latter began at once to descend as if either he or his machine
      were hit, and shutting off his engine and volplaning to free his hands,
      the pursuer recharged his magazine. Unfortunately it jammed, but he
      managed to insert four cartridges and to fire them at his descending
      opponent, who disappeared into a cloud bank with dramatic suddenness.
      When the British officer emerged below the clouds he could see no sign of
      the other. He, therefore, climbed to an altitude of some 7,000 feet and
      came to the conclusion that the German must have come to earth in the
      French lines.</p>

      <p>The French airmen, too, have been very successful during the last
      three days, having dropped several bombs among the German cavalry and
      caused considerable loss and disorder, and having by similar means
      silenced a battery of field howitzers.</p>

      <p>The German anti-aircraft guns recently have been unusually active.
      From their rate of fire they seem to be nearly automatic, but so far they
      have not had much effect in reducing the air reconnoissances carried out
      by us.</p>

      <p>A striking feature of our line&mdash;to use the conventional term
      which so seldom expresses accurately the position taken up by an
      army&mdash;is that it consists really of a series of trenches not all
      placed alongside each other, but some more advanced than others, and many
      facing in different directions. At one place they run east and west along
      one side of a valley. At another almost north and south up some
      subsidiary valley.  Here they line the edge of woods, and there they are
      on the reverse slope of a hill, or possibly along a sunken road, and at
      different points both the German and the British trenches jut out like
      promontories into what might be regarded as the opponents' territory.</p>

      <p>Though both sides have moved forward at certain points, and withdrawn
      at others, no very important change has been effected in their
      dispositions, in spite of the enemy's repeated counter attacks. These
      have been directed principally against one portion of the position won by
      us, but in spite of the lavish expenditure of life they have not so far
      succeeded in driving us back.</p>

      <p>The situation of the works in the German front line as a whole has
      been a matter of deliberate selection, for they have had the advantage of
      previous reconnaissance, being first in the field.</p>

      <p>Behind the front they now have several lines prepared for a
      step-by-step defense. Another point which might cause astonishment to a
      visitor to our intrenchments is the evident indifference displayed to the
      provision of an extended field of frontal rifle fire, which is generally
      accepted as being one of the great requirements of a defensive position.
      It is still desirable, if it can be obtained without the usually
      accompanying drawback of exposure to the direct fire of hostile
      artillery, but experience has shown that a short field of fire is
      sufficient to beat back the infantry assaults of the enemy, and by giving
      up direct fire at long or medium ranges and placing our trenches on the
      reverse slope of a hill or behind the crest, it is in many places
      possible to gain shelter from the frontal fire of the German guns, for
      the men are well trained in musketry and under good fire control, and the
      dead ground beyond the short range from their position has comparatively
      small terrors.</p>

      <p>Many of the front trenches of the Germans equally lack a distant field
      of fire, but if lost they would be rendered untenable by us by the fact
      that they would be exposed to a fire from the German guns in the rear and
      to cross-rifle fire from neighboring works.</p>

      <p>The extent to which cross-fire of all kinds is employed is also
      remarkable. Many localities and areas along the Aisne are not swept from
      the works directly in front of them, but are rendered untenable by rifle
      fire from neighboring features or by that of guns that are out of sight.
      So much is this the case that among these hills and valleys it is a
      difficult matter for troops to find out whence they are being shot
      at.</p>

      <p>There is a perpetual triangular duel. A's infantry can see nothing to
      shoot at, but are under fire from B's guns. The action of B's guns then
      brings upon them the attention of some of A's artillery waiting for a
      target, the latter being in their turn assailed by other batteries. And
      so it goes on. In a wooded country in spite of aeroplanes and balloons
      smokeless powder has made the localization and identification of targets
      a matter of supreme difficulty.</p>


      <h3 class="one">VIII.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">The Men in the Trenches.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Dated Oct. 13.]</p>

      <p>On the firing line the men sleep and obtain shelter in dug-outs they
      have hollowed or cut under the sides of the trenches.  These refuges are
      raised slightly above the bottom of the trench, so as to remain dry in
      wet weather. The floor of the trench also is sloped for purposes of
      draining. Some of the trenches are provided with overhead cover which
      gives protection from the weather as well as from shrapnel balls and
      splinters of shells. Considerable ingenuity has been exercised by the men
      in naming these shelters. Among the favorite designations are the "Hotel
      Cecil," the "Ritz Hotel," the "Billet-Doux Hotel," and the "Rue
      Dormir."</p>

      <p>On the road barricades also are to be found boards bearing this
      notice: "This way to the Prussians."</p>

      <p>Obstacles of every kind abound, and at night each side can hear the
      enemy driving pickets for entanglements, digging <i>trous-de-loup</i>, or
      working forward by sapping. In some places obstacles have been
      constructed by both sides so close together that some wag suggested that
      each side provide working parties to perform this fatigue duty
      alternately, inasmuch as the work of the enemy is now almost
      indistinguishable from ours, and serves the same purpose.</p>

      <p>Quarries and caves, to which allusion already has been made, provide
      ample accommodation for whole battalions, and most comfortable are these
      shelters which have been constructed in them. The northern slopes of the
      Aisne Valley fortunately are very steep, and this to a great extent
      protects us from the enemy's shells, many of which pass harmlessly over
      our heads, to burst in the meadows along the river bank.</p>

      <p>At all points subject to shell fire access to the firing line from
      behind is provided by communication trenches. These are now so good that
      it is possible to cross in safety a fire-swept zone to the advance
      trenches from billets in villages, bivouacs in quarries, or other places
      where the headquarters of units happen to be.</p>

      <p>It already has been mentioned that according to information obtained
      from the enemy fifteen Germans were killed by a bomb dropped upon the
      ammunition wagon of a cavalry column. It was thought at the time that
      this might have been the work of one of our airmen, who reported that he
      had dropped a hand grenade on this convoy, and had then got a bird's-eye
      view of the finest display of fireworks he had ever seen. From
      corroborative evidence it now appears that this was the case; that the
      grenade thrown by him probably was the cause of the destruction of a
      small convoy carrying field-gun and howitzer ammunition, which now has
      been found a total wreck.</p>

      <p>Along the road lie fourteen motor lorries, their iron skeletons
      twisted and broken. Everything inflammable has been burned, as have the
      stripped trees&mdash;some with split trunks&mdash;on either side of the
      road. Of the drivers, nothing remains except tattered boots and charred
      scraps of clothing, while the ground within a radius of fifty yards of
      the wagons is littered with pieces of iron, split brass cartridge cases,
      which have exploded, and some fixed-gun ammunition with live shells.</p>

      <p>If it were possible to reconstruct this incident, if it was, in fact,
      brought about as supposed, the grenade from the aeroplane must have
      detonated on the leading lorry, on one side of the road, and caused the
      cartridges carried by it to explode. Three vehicles immediately in the
      rear must then have been set on fire, with a similar result. Behind these
      are groups of four and two vehicles so jammed together as to suggest that
      they must have collided in desperate attempts to stop. On the other side
      of the road, almost level with the leading wagon, are found more
      vehicles, which probably were fired by the explosion of the first.</p>

      <p>If this appalling destruction was due to one hand grenade, it is an
      illustration of the potentialities of a small amount of high explosive
      detonated in the right spot, while the nature of the place where the
      disaster occurred, a narrow forest road between high trees, is a
      testimony to the skill of the airmen.</p>

      <p>It is only fair to add that some French newspapers claim this damage
      to the enemy was caused by the action of a detachment of their
      dragoons.</p>

      <h3 class="two">1,100 Dead in a Single Trench.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Official Summary, Dated Oct. 27.]</p>

      <p>The Official Bureau makes public today the story of an eye-witness,
      supplementing the account issued on Oct. 24, and bringing the story of
      the general course of operations in France up to Oct. 20.  The arrival of
      reinforcements, it says, enabled the British troops to assist in the
      extension of the Allies' line where the Germans advanced from the
      northeast and east, holding a front extending from Mont Descats, about
      ten miles northeast of Hazebrouck, through Meteren, five miles south of
      that point, and thence to Estaires, thirteen miles west of Lille, on the
      River Lys. The statement continues:</p>

      <p>"South of the Lys the German line extended to three miles east of
      Bethune to Vermelles. The Allies encountered resistance all along the
      line on the 12th and 13th, when the enemy's right fell back hastily.
      Bailleul, seventeen miles northwest by west of Lille, which had been
      occupied by the foe for eight days, was abandoned without a shot being
      fired.</p>

      <p>"On the 14th our left wing advanced, driving the enemy back, and on
      the night of the 15th we were in possession of all the country on the
      left bank of the Lys to a point five miles below Armenti&egrave;res. The
      enemy retired from that town on the 16th, and the river line, to within a
      short distance of Frelinghien, fell into our hands.</p>

      <p>"The state of the crossings over the Lys indicated that no organized
      scheme of defense had been executed, some of the bridges being in a state
      of repair, others merely barricaded, while one was not even defended or
      broken.</p>

      <p>"The resistance offered to our advance on the 15th was of a most
      determined character. The fighting consisted of fiercely contested
      encounters, infantry attacks on the villages being unavailing until our
      howitzers reduced the houses to ruins. Other villages were taken and
      retaken three times before they were finally secured.</p>

      <p>"The French cavalry here gave welcome support, and on the evening of
      the 16th the resistance was overcome, the enemy retiring five miles to
      the eastward."</p>

      <p>Describing an incident of the fighting on this night, the narrative
      says that the important crossing of the Lys at Warneton was strongly held
      by the Germans with a barricade loopholed at the bottom to enable the men
      to fire while lying down.</p>

      <p>"Our cavalry, with the artillery, blew the barricade to pieces and
      scattered the defenders," the narrative continues. "Advancing
      three-quarters of a mile our troops reached the square, when one of the
      buildings appeared to leap skyward. A sheet of flame and a shower of star
      shells at the same time made the place as light as day and enabled the
      enemy, ensconced in surrounding houses, to pour a devastating fire from
      rifles and machine guns. Our cavalry extricated themselves with the loss
      of one officer wounded and nine men killed and wounded, but a party of
      volunteers went back and carried off their wounded comrades from the
      inferno.</p>

      <p>"During the 17th, 18th, and 19th of October our right encountered
      strong opposition from the enemy about La Bass&eacute;e, where they had
      established themselves behind embankments. On the centre and the left we
      made better progress, although the Germans were everywhere intrenched,
      and, in spite of the bombardment, held some villages on the Lys. At the
      close of each day a night counter stroke was delivered against one or
      another part of our line, but they were all repulsed.</p>

      <p>"Tuesday, Oct. 20, a determined but unsuccessful attack was made
      against virtually the whole of our line. At one point where one of our
      brigades made a counter attack 1,100 German dead were found in a trench
      and forty prisoners were taken."</p>

      <p>The narrative points out that the advance of the Allies has been
      hindered by the weather and the nature of the ground, together with the
      impossibility of knowing beforehand the reception that advance
      detachments were likely to meet in approaching any village or town. "One
      place may be evacuated hastily as untenable," the recital continues,
      "while another in the same general line will continue to resist for a
      considerable time. In some villages the inhabitants meet our cyclists
      with kisses, while at the next one the roads will, in all probability,
      have trenches cut across them and blocked with barricades and machine
      guns. Under these circumstances an incautious advance is severely
      punished, and it is impossible for large bodies of troops to push on
      until the front has been thoroughly reconnoitred. This work requires the
      highest qualities from our cavalry, our cyclists, and our advanced
      guards.</p>

      <p>Armored motor cars equipped with machine guns are now playing a part
      in the war, and have been most successful in dealing with small parties
      of German mounted troops. In their employment our gallant allies, the
      Belgians, who are now fighting with us and acquitting themselves nobly,
      have shown themselves to be experts. They appear to regard Uhlan hunting
      as a form of sport. The crews display the utmost dash and skill in this
      form of warfare, often going out several miles ahead of their own
      advanced troops and seldom failing to return loaded with spoils in the
      shape of lancers' caps, busbies, helmets, lances, rifles, and other
      trophies, which they distribute as souvenirs to the crowds in the market
      places of the frontier towns.</p>

      <p>Although the struggle in the northern area naturally attracts more
      attention than the one in the Aisne, the fighting in this region still
      continues. Although there has been no alteration in the general
      situation, the enemy has made certain changes in the positions of his
      heavy artillery, with the result that one or two places which formerly
      were safe are now subject to bombardment, while others which were
      approachable only at night or by crawling on hands and knees now serve as
      recreation grounds. At one point even a marquee tent has been
      erected.</p>

      <p>A story from this quarter illustrates a new use for the craters made
      by the explosions of the "Black Marias," the name given by the men to the
      projectiles of the big German howitzers. An officer on patrol stumbled in
      the dark on the German trenches. He turned and made for the British
      lines, but the fire directed at him was so heavy that he had to throw
      himself on the ground and crawl. There was no cover at hand, and his
      chances looked desperate, when he saw close by an enormous hole in the
      ground made by one of these large shells. Into this he scrambled and
      remained there for a night and a day. When night again came he succeeded
      in reaching our lines in safety.</p>

      <p>Official casualty lists of recent date which have been captured show
      that the losses of the Germans continue to be heavy. One single list
      shows that a company of German infantry had 139 men killed and wounded,
      or more than half of its war establishment. Other companies suffered
      almost as heavily. It further appears that the number of men reported
      missing&mdash;that is, those who have fallen into the hands of the enemy
      or who have become marauders&mdash;is much greater in the reserve
      battalions than in the first line units. This is evidence of the inferior
      quality of some of the reserves now being brought up to reinforce the
      enemy field army, and it is all the more encouraging, since every day
      adds to our first line strength.</p>

      <p>The arrival of the Indian contingents caused every one to realize that
      while the enemy was filling his depleted ranks with immature levies, we
      have large reserves of perfectly fresh and thoroughly trained troops to
      draw upon.</p>


      <h3 class="one">X.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">Nature of Fighting Changes.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Dated Oct. 26.]</p>

      <p>Before the
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'narative']">narrative</ins>
      of the progress of the fighting near the Franco-Belgian frontier
      subsequent to Oct. 20 is continued a brief description will be given of
      the movement of a certain fraction of our troops from its former line
      facing north, on the east of Paris, to its present position facing east,
      in the northwest corner of France, by which a portion of the British Army
      has been enabled to join hands with the incoming and growing stream of
      reinforcements.</p>

      <p>This is now an accomplished fact, as is generally known, and can
      therefore be explained in some detail without detriment. Mention will
      also be made of the gradual development up to Oct. 20 in the nature of
      the operations in this quarter of the theatre of war, which has recently
      come into such prominence.</p>

      <p>In its broad lines the transfer of strength by one combatant during
      the course of a great battle which has just been accomplished is somewhat
      remarkable. It can best be compared with the action of the Japanese
      during the battle of Mukden, when Gen. Oku withdrew a portion of his
      force from his front, moved it northward behind the line, and threw it
      into the fight again near the extreme left of the Japanese armies.</p>

      <p>In general direction, though not in scope or possible results, owing
      to the coast line being reached by the Allies, the
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'parellel']">parallel</ins>
      is complete. The Japanese force concerned, however, was much smaller than
      ours and the distance covered by it was less than that from the Aisne to
      the Franco-Belgian frontier. Gen. Oku's troops, moreover, marched,
      whereas ours were moved by march, rail, and motor.</p>

      <p>What was implied in the actual withdrawal from contact with the enemy
      along the Aisne will be appreciated when the conditions under which we
      were then situated are recalled.</p>

      <p>In places the two lines were not one hundred yards apart, and for us
      no movement was possible during daylight. In some of the trenches which
      were under enfilade fire our men had to sit all day long close under the
      traverses&mdash;as are called those mounds of earth which stretch like
      partitions at intervals across a trench so as to give protection from
      lateral fire. Even where there was cover, such as that afforded by
      depressions or sunken roads, on the hillside below and behind our firing
      line, any attempt to cross the intervening space was met by fierce bursts
      of machine gun and shell fire.</p>

      <p>The men in the firing line were on duty for twenty-four hours at a
      time, and brought rations and water with them when they came on duty, for
      none could be sent up to them during the day. Even the wounded could not
      be removed until dark.</p>

      <p>The preliminary retirement of the units was therefore carried out
      gradually, under cover of darkness. That the Germans only once opened
      fire on them while so engaged was due to the care with which the
      operation was conducted, and also, probably, to the fact that the enemy
      were so accustomed to the recurrence of the sounds made by the reliefs of
      the men in the firing line and by the movement of the supply trains below
      that they were misled as to what was actually taking place.</p>

      <p>What the operation amounted to on our part was the evacuation of the
      trenches, under carefully made arrangements with the French who had to
      take our place in the trenches; the retirement to the river
      below&mdash;in many cases down a steep slope; the crossing of the river
      over the noisy plank roadways of floating or repaired bridges, which were
      mostly commanded by the enemy's guns&mdash;and the climb up to the top of
      the plateau on the south side.</p>

      <p>The rest of the move was a complicated feat of transportation which
      cut across some of the lines of communication of our allies; but it
      requires no description here. In spite of the various difficulties, the
      whole strategic operation of transferring the large number of troops from
      the Aisne was carried out without loss and practically without a
      hitch.</p>

      <p>As regards the change in the nature of the fighting in which we have
      recently been engaged, it has already been pointed out that the
      operations had up till then been of a preparatory nature and that the
      Germans were obviously seeking to delay us by advanced troops while
      heavier forces were being got ready and brought up to the scene of
      action. It was known that they were raising a new army, consisting of
      corps formed of Ersatz, (supernumerary reserves), volunteers, and other
      material which had not yet been drawn upon, and that part of it would in
      all probability be sent to the western theatre, either to cover the
      troops laying siege to Antwerp, in case that place should hold out, or,
      in the event of the capture of the fortress, to act in conjunction with
      the besieging force in a violent offensive movement toward the coast.</p>

      <p>After the fall of Antwerp and the release of the besieging troops
      there was a gradual increase in the strength of the opposition met with
      by us.</p>

      <p>The resistance of the detachments&mdash;which beyond the right extreme
      of the German fortified line near Bethune a fortnight ago consisted
      almost entirely of cavalry&mdash;grew more and more determined as more
      infantry and guns came into the front line, until Tuesday, Oct. 20, when
      the arrival opposite us of a large portion of the new formations and a
      considerable number of heavy guns enabled the enemy to assume the
      offensive practically against the whole of our line at the same time that
      they attacked the Belgians between us and the coast.</p>

      <p>The operations then really assumed a fresh complexion.</p>

      <p>Since that date, up to the 25th, apart from the operations on either
      side of us, there has been plenty of action to chronicle on our immediate
      front, where some of the heaviest fighting in which we have yet been
      engaged has taken place, resulting in immense loss to the Germans.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, the 21st, the new German formations again pressed
      forward in force vigorously all along our line. On our right, south of
      the Lys, an attack on Violaines was repulsed with loss to the
      assailants.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, we were driven from some ground close by, to the
      north, but regained it by a counter attack.</p>

      <p>Still further north the Germans gained and retained some points.</p>

      <p>Their total casualties to the southeast of Armentieres are estimated
      at over 6,000.</p>

      <p>On the north of the Lys, in our centre, a fiercely contested action
      took place near La Gheir, which village was captured in the morning by
      the enemy and then retaken by us. In this direction the German casualties
      were also extremely heavy. They came on with the greatest bravery, in
      swarms, only to be swept away by our fire. One battalion of their 104th
      Regiment was practically wiped out, some 400 dead being picked up by us
      in our lines alone.</p>

      <p>Incidentally, by our counter attack, we took 130 prisoners and
      released some forty of our own men who had been surrounded and captured,
      including a subaltern of artillery who had been cut off while observing
      from a point of vantage.</p>

      <p>It is agreeable to record that our men were very well treated by their
      captors, who were Saxons, being placed in cellars for protection from the
      bombardment of our own guns.</p>

      <p>On our left our troops advanced against the German 26th Reserve Corps
      near Passchendaele, and were met by a determined counter offensive, which
      was driven back with great loss. At night the Germans renewed their
      efforts unsuccessfully in this quarter.</p>

      <p>At one point they tried a ruse which is no longer new. As they came up
      in a solid line two deep they shouted out: "Don't fire; we are the
      Coldstream Guards."</p>

      <p>But our men are getting used to tricks of this kind, and the only
      result of this "slimness" was that they allowed the enemy's infantry to
      approach, quite close before they swept them down with magazine fire.</p>

      <p>Apart from the 400 dead found near our lines in our centre, our
      patrols afterwards discovered some 300 dead further out in front of our
      left, killed by our artillery.</p>

      <p>Thursday, the 22d, saw a renewal of the pressure against us. We
      succeeded, however, in holding our ground in nearly every quarter.</p>

      <p>South of the Lys the enemy attacked from La Bass&eacute;e, and gained
      Violaines and another point, but their effort against a third village was
      repulsed by artillery fire alone, the French and British guns working
      together very effectively. On the north of the river it was a day of
      minor attacks against us, which were all beaten back.</p>

      <p>The Germans advanced in the evening against our centre and left, and
      were again hurled back, though they gained some of our trenches in the
      latter quarter. By this time the enemy had succeeded in bringing up
      several heavy howitzers, and our casualties were considerable.</p>

      <p>On Friday, the 23d, all action south of the Lys on our right was
      confined to that of the artillery, several of the hostile batteries being
      silenced by our fire? In the centre their infantry again endeavored to
      force their way forward, and were only repulsed after determined
      fighting, leaving many dead on the ground and several prisoners in our
      hands. North of the Lys attacks at different points were repulsed.</p>

      <p>On our left the 23d was a bad day for the Germans. Advancing in our
      turn, we drove them from some of the trenches out of which they had
      turned us on the previous evening, captured 150 prisoners, and released
      some of our men whom they had taken.</p>

      <p>As the Germans retreated our guns did great execution among them.</p>

      <p>They afterwards made five desperate assaults on our trenches,
      advancing in mass and singing "Die Wacht am Rhein" as they came on. Each
      assault was easily beaten back, our troops waiting until the enemy came
      to very close range before they opened fire with rifles and Maxims,
      causing terrible havoc in the solid masses.</p>

      <p>During the fighting in this quarter on the night of the 22d and on the
      23d the German losses were again extremely heavy. We made over 600
      prisoners during that time and picked up 1,500 dead, killed on the latter
      day alone.</p>

      <p>Much of the slaughter was due to the point blank magazine fire of our
      men against the German assaults, while our field guns and howitzers,
      working in perfect combination, did their share when the enemy were
      repulsed. As they fell back they were subjected to a shower of shrapnel.
      When they sought shelter in villages or buildings they were shattered and
      driven out by high-explosive shells and then again caught by shrapnel as
      they came into the open.</p>

      <p>The troops to suffer so severely were mostly of Twenty-third Corps,
      one of their new formations.</p>

      <p>Certainly the way their advance was conducted showed a lack of
      training and faults in leading which the almost superhuman bravery of the
      soldiers could not counterbalance. It was a holocaust.</p>

      <p>The spectacle of these devoted men chanting a national song as they
      marched on to certain death was inspiring. It was at the same time
      pitiable.</p>

      <p>And if any proof were needed that untrained valor alone cannot gain
      the day in modern war, the advance of the Twenty-third German Corps on
      Oct.  23 most assuredly furnished it.</p>

      <p>Besides doing its share of execution on the hostile infantry, our
      artillery in this quarter brought down a German captive balloon.</p>

      <p>As some gauge of the rate at which the guns were firing at what was
      for them an ideal target, it may be mentioned that one field battery
      expended 1,800 rounds of ammunition during the day.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, the 24th, action on our right was once more confined to
      that of artillery, except at night, when the Germans pressed on, only to
      be repulsed.</p>

      <p>In the centre, near Armenti&egrave;res, our troops withstood three
      separate attempts of the enemy to push forward, our guns coming into play
      with good effect. Against our left the German Twenty-seventh Corps made a
      violent effort with no success.</p>

      <p>On Sunday, the 25th, it was our turn to take the offensive. This was
      carried out by a portion of our left wing, which advanced, gained some
      ground, and took two guns and eighty prisoners. It is believed that six
      machine guns fell to the French.</p>

      <p>In the centre the fighting was severe, though generally indecisive in
      result, and the troops in some places were engaged in hand-to-hand
      combat. Toward evening we captured 200 prisoners.</p>

      <p>On the right action was again confined to that of the guns.</p>

      <p>Up to the night of the 25th, therefore, not only have we maintained
      our position against the great effort on the part of the enemy to break
      through to the west, or to force us back, which started on the 20th; we
      have on our left passed to the offensive.</p>

      <p>These six days, as may be gathered, have been spent by us in repelling
      a succession of desperate onslaughts. It is true that the efforts against
      us have been made to a great extent by partially trained men, some of
      whom appear to be suffering from lack of food. But it must not be
      forgotten that these troops, which are in great force, have only recently
      been brought into the field, and are therefore comparatively fresh. They
      are fighting also with the utmost determination, in spite of the fact
      that many of them are heartily sick of the war.</p>

      <p>The struggle has been of the most severe and sanguinary nature, and it
      seems that success will favor that side which is possessed of most
      endurance, or can bring up and fling fresh forces into the fray. Though
      we have undoubtedly inflicted immense loss upon the enemy, they have so
      far been able to fill up the gaps in their ranks and to return to the
      charge, and we have suffered heavily ourselves.</p>

      <p>One feature of the tactics now employed has been the use of cavalry in
      dismounted action, for on both sides many of the mounted troops are
      fighting in the trenches alongside the infantry.</p>

      <p>Armored motor cars, armed with Maxims and light quick-firing guns,
      also have recently played a useful part on our side, especially in
      helping to eject the enemy lurking in villages and isolated buildings.
      Against such parties the combined action of the quick-firer against the
      snipers in buildings, and the Maxim against them when they are driven
      into the open, is most efficacious.</p>


      <h3 class="one">XI.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">The British Defense at Ypres.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Dated Nov. 13.]</p>

      <p>The diminution in the force of the German rush to the west has not
      lasted long. The section of the front to the north of our forces was the
      first to meet the recrudescence of violence in the shape of an attack in
      the neighborhood of Dixmude and Bixschoote.</p>

      <p>Our turn came next. After eight days of comparative relaxation we were
      under constant pressure from Tuesday, Nov. 3, to Tuesday, the 10th. The
      next day saw a repetition of the great attempt of the Germans to break
      through our lines to the French coast.</p>

      <p>What was realized might happen did happen. In spite of the immense
      losses suffered by the enemy during the five-day attack against Ypres,
      which lasted from Oct. 29 to the 2d of this month, the cessation of their
      more violent efforts on the latter day did not signalize the abandonment
      of the whole project, but merely the temporary relinquishment of the main
      offensive until fresh troops had been massed to carry on what was proving
      to be a costly and difficult operation.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile the interval was employed in endeavoring to wear out the
      Allies by repeated local attacks of varying force and to shatter them by
      a prolonged and concentrated bombardment. By the 11th, therefore, it
      seems that they considered they had attained both objects, for on that
      day they recommenced the desperate battle for the possession of Ypres and
      its neighborhood.</p>

      <p>Though the struggle has not yet come to an end, this much can be said:
      The Germans have gained some ground, but they have not captured
      Ypres.</p>

      <p>In repulsing the enemy so far we have suffered heavy casualties, but
      battles of this fierce and prolonged nature cannot but be costly to both
      sides. We have the satisfaction of knowing that we have foiled the enemy
      in what appears to be at present his main object in the western theatre
      of operations, and have inflicted immensely greater losses on him than
      those we have suffered ourselves.</p>

      <p>To carry on the narrative for the three days of the 10th, 11th, and
      12th of November:</p>

      <p>Tuesday, the 10th, was uneventful for us. At some distance beyond our
      left flank the enemy advanced in force against the French and were
      repulsed. Directly on our left, however, along the greater part of the
      front, shelling was less severe, and no infantry attacks took place.</p>

      <p>To the southeast of Ypres the enemy kept up a very heavy bombardment
      against our line, as well as that of the French. On our left centre the
      situation remained unchanged, both sides contenting themselves with
      furious cannonading. In our centre the Germans retained their hold on the
      small amount of ground which they had gained from us, but in doing so
      incurred a heavy loss from our artillery and machine gun fire.</p>

      <p>Incidentally, one of the houses held by the enemy was so knocked about
      by our fire that its defenders bolted. On their way to the rear they were
      met by reinforcements under an officer who halted them, evidently in an
      endeavor to persuade them to return. While the parley Was going on one of
      our machine guns was quietly moved to a position of vantage, whence it
      opened a most effective fire on the group.</p>

      <p>On our right one of the enemy's saps, which was being pushed toward
      our line, was attacked by us. All the men in it were captured.</p>

      <p>Wednesday, the 11th, was another day of desperate fighting. As day
      broke the Germans opened fire on our trenches to the north and south of
      the road from Menin to Ypres. This was probably the most furious
      artillery fire which they have yet employed against us.</p>

      <p>A few hours later they followed this by an infantry assault in force.
      This attack was carried out by the First and Fourth brigades of the Guard
      Corps, which, as we now know from prisoners, have been sent for to make a
      supreme effort to capture Ypres, since that task had proved too heavy for
      the infantry of the line.</p>

      <p>As the attackers surged forward they were met by our frontal fire, and
      since they were moving diagonally across part of our front they were also
      attacked on the flank by artillery, rifles, and machine guns.  Though
      their casualties before they reached our line must have been enormous,
      such was their resolution and the momentum of the mass that in spite of
      the splendid resistance of our troops they succeeded in breaking through
      our line in three places near the road. They penetrated some distance
      into the woods behind our trenches, but were counter-attacked again,
      enfiladed by machine guns and driven back to their line of trenches, a
      certain portion of which they succeeded in holding, in spite of our
      efforts to expel them.</p>

      <p>What their total losses must have been during this advance may be
      gauged to some extent from the fact that the number of dead left in the
      woods behind our line alone amounted to 700.</p>

      <p>A simultaneous effort made to the south, a part of the same operation
      although not carried out by the Guard Corps, failed entirely, for when
      the attacking infantry massed in the woods close to our line, our guns
      opened on them with such effect that they did not push the assault
      home.</p>

      <p>As generally happens in operations in wooded country, the fighting to
      a great extent was carried on at close quarters. It was most desperate
      and confused. Scattered bodies of the enemy who had penetrated into the
      woods in the rear of our position could neither go backward nor forward,
      and were nearly all killed or captured.</p>

      <p>The portion of the line to the southeast of Ypres held by us was
      heavily shelled, but did not undergo any very serious infantry attack.
      That occupied by the French, however, was both bombarded and fiercely
      assaulted. On the rest of our front, save for the usual bombardment, all
      was comparatively quiet.</p>

      <p>On the right one of our trenches was mined and then abandoned. As soon
      as it was occupied by the enemy the charges were fired and several
      Germans were blown to pieces.</p>

      <p>Thursday, Nov. 12, was marked by a partial lull in the fighting all
      along our line. To the north a German force which had crossed the Yser
      and intrenched on the left bank was annihilated by a night attack with
      the bayonet, executed by the French. Slightly to the south the enemy was
      forced back for three-quarters of a mile. Immediately on our left the
      French were strongly attacked and driven back a short distance, our
      extreme left having to conform to this movement. Our allies soon
      recovered the ground they had lost, however, and this enabled us to
      advance also.</p>

      <p>To the southeast of Ypres the enemy's snipers were very active. On our
      centre and right the enemy's bombardment was maintained, but nothing
      worthy of special note occurred.</p>

      <p>The fact that on this day the advance against our line in front of
      Ypres was not pushed home after such an effort as that of Wednesday tends
      to show that for the moment the attacking troops had had enough.</p>

      <p>Although the failure of this great attack by the Guard Corps to
      accomplish their object cannot be described as a decisive event, it
      possibly marks the culmination if not the close of the second stage in
      the attempt to capture Ypres, arid it is not without significance. It has
      also a dramatic interest of its own. Having once definitely failed to
      achieve this object by means of the sheer weight of numbers, and having
      done their best to wear us down, the Germans brought in fresh picked
      troops to carry the Ypres salient by an assault from the north, the south
      and the east. That the Guard Corps should have been selected to act
      against the eastern edge of the salient may be taken as proof of the
      necessity felt by the Germans to gain this point in the line.</p>

      <p>Their dogged perseverance in pursuance of their objective claims
      whole-hearted admiration. The failure of one great attack, heralded as it
      was by an impassioned appeal to the troops made in the presence of the
      Emperor himself, but carried out by partially trained men, has been only
      the signal for another desperate effort in which the place of honor was
      assigned to the corps d'&eacute;lite of the German Army.</p>

      <p>It must be admitted that the Guard Corps has retained that reputation
      for courage and contempt of death which it earned in 1870, when Emperor
      William I., after the battle of Gravelotte, wrote: "My Guard has found
      its grave in front of St. Privat," and the swarms of men who came up
      bravely to the British rifles in the woods around Ypres repeated the
      tactics of forty-four years ago when their dense columns, toiling up the
      slopes of St. Privat, melted away under the fire of the French.</p>

      <p>That the Germans are cunning fighters, and well up in all the tricks
      of the trade, has frequently been pointed out. For instance, they often
      succeed in ascertaining what regiment or brigade is opposed to them, and
      because of their knowledge of English, they are able to employ the
      information to some purpose. On a recent occasion, having by some means
      discovered the name of the commander of the company holding the trench
      they were attacking, they called him by name, asking if Captain
      &mdash;&mdash; was there. Fortunately the pronunciation of the spokesman
      was somewhat defective, and their curiosity was rewarded by discovering
      that both the officer in question and his men were very much there.</p>

      <p>There have been reports from so many different quarters of the enemy
      having been seen wearing British and French uniforms that it is
      impossible to doubt their truth. One absolutely authentic case occurred
      during the fighting near Ypres. A man dressed in a uniform closely
      resembling that of a British staff officer suddenly appeared near our
      trenches and walked along the line. He asked if many casualties had been
      suffered, stated that the situation was serious, and that a general
      retirement had been ordered. A similar visit having been reported by
      several men in different trenches, orders were issued that this strange
      officer was to be detained if seen again. Unluckily he did not make
      another appearance.</p>

      <p>The following remarks taken from the diary of a German soldier are
      published not because there is reason to believe they are justified with
      regard to the conduct of German officers but because of their interest as
      a human document. Under date of Nov. 2 this German soldier wrote:</p>

      <blockquote>
         <p>Previous to noon we were sent out in a regular storm of bullets on
         the order of the Major. These gentlemen, the officers, send their men
         forward in a most ridiculous way. They themselves remain far behind,
         safely under cover. Our leadership is really scandalous.  Enormous
         losses on our side are partly from the fire of our own people, for our
         leaders neither know where the enemy lies nor where our own troops
         are, so that we often are fired on by our own men.  It is a marvel to
         me that we have got on as far as we have done.</p>

         <p>Our Captain fell, as did also all our section leaders and a large
         number of our men. Moreover, no purpose was served by this advance,
         for we remained the rest of the day under cover; we could go neither
         forward nor back, nor even shoot.</p>

         <p>The trench we had taken was not occupied by us. The English
         naturally took it back at night. That was the sole result. Then when
         the enemy had intrenched themselves another attack was made, costing
         us many lives and fifty prisoners. It is simply ridiculous, this
         leadership. If only I had known it before! My opinion of German
         officers has changed.</p>

         <p>An Adjutant shouted to us from a trench far to the rear to cut down
         a hedge in front of us. Bullets were whistling round from in front and
         from behind. The gentleman himself, of course, remained behind.</p>

         <p>The Fourth Company has now no leaders but a couple of non-coms.
         When will my turn come! I hope to goodness I shall get home again.</p>

         <p>In the trenches shells and shrapnel burst without ceasing. In the
         evening we get a cup of rice and one-third of an apple per man. Let us
         hope peace will soon come. Such a war is really too awful. The English
         shoot like mad. If no reinforcements come up, especially heavy
         artillery, we shall have a poor lookout and must retire.</p>

         <p>The first day I went quietly into the fight with an indifference
         which astonished me. Today, for the first time, in advancing, when my
         comrades on the right and left were falling, I felt rather nervous.
         But I lost that feeling again soon. One becomes horribly
         indifferent.</p>

         <p>I picked up a piece of bread by chance. Thank God! At least I have
         something to eat.</p>

         <p>There are about 70,000 English who must be attacked from all four
         sides and destroyed. However, they defend themselves obstinately.</p>

      <h3 class="one">XII.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">Attacked by 750,000 Germans.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Official Summary, Dated Dec. 3.]</p>

      <p>Col. E.D. Swinton of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff
      of the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium, in a narrative
      dated Nov. 26, gives a general review of the development of the situation
      of the force for six weeks preceding that date.</p>

      <p>There has recently been a lull in the active operations, he says. No
      progress has been made by either side, and yet there has come about an
      important modification comprising a readjustment in the scope of the part
      played by the British Army as a whole. He explains the movement from the
      River Aisne to the Belgian frontier to prolong the left flank of the
      French Army, and says that in attempting this the British force was
      compelled to assume responsibility for a very extended section of the
      front. He points out, as did Field Marshal Sir John French, Commander in
      Chief of the British forces, that the British held only one-twelfth of
      the line, so that the greater share of the common task of opposing the
      enemy fell and still falls to the French, while the Belgians played an
      almost vital part.</p>

      <p>With the fall of Antwerp the Germans made every effort to push forward
      a besieging force toward the west and hastened to bring up a new army
      corps which had been hastily raised and trained, their object being to
      drive the Allies out of Belgium and break through to Dunkirk and Calais.
      Altogether they had a quarter of a million of fresh men. Eventually the
      Germans had north of La Bass&eacute;e about fourteen corps and eight cavalry
      divisions, that is, "a force of three-quarters of a million of men with
      which to attempt to drive the Allies into the sea. In addition, there was
      immensely powerful armament and heavy siege artillery, which also had
      been brought up from around Antwerp."</p>

      <p>The official eye-witness tells of the blows delivered by the Germans
      at Nieuport, Dixmude, and Ypres, where "at first the Allies were greatly
      outnumbered." For a whole month the British army around Ypres succeeded
      in holding its ground against repeated onslaughts made by vastly superior
      forces. The writer goes into details of the German attacks and describes
      how they were frustrated by the Allies.</p>

      <p>The British force, says Col. Swinton, which consisted all along of the
      same units, had "to withstand an almost continuous bombardment and to
      meet one desperate assault after another, each carried out by fresh units
      from the large numbers which the Germans were devoting to the operation."
      Finally the French came to their assistance, and "never was help more
      welcome; for by then our small local reserves had again and again been
      thrown into the fight in the execution of counter-attacks, and our men
      were exhausted by the incessant fighting."</p>

      <p>The British front now has been considerably shortened and in addition
      has been reinforced, while a lull in the activity has enabled the British
      to readjust their forces, strengthen their positions, and bring up
      reserves. There has, therefore, "been a great general improvement in the
      conditions under which we are carrying on the fight". Of the fighting
      which preceded this reorganization the writer says it is due solely to
      the resource, initiative, and endurance of the regimental officers and
      men that success has lain with the British. He continues:</p>

      <p>"As the struggle swayed backward and forward through wood and hamlet,
      the fighting assumed a most confused and desperate character. The units
      became inextricably mixed, and in many cases, in order to strengthen some
      threatened point or to fill a gap in the line, the officers had to
      collect and throw into the fight what men they could, regardless of the
      units to which they belonged. Our casualties have been severe; but we
      have been fighting a battle, and a battle implies casualties, and, heavy
      as they have been, it must be remembered that they have not been suffered
      in vain.</p>

      <p>"The duty of the French, Belgians, and British in the western theatre
      of operations has been to act as a containing force; in other words, to
      hold on to and to keep occupied as many of the enemy as possible while
      the Russians were attacking in the east. In this we have succeeded in
      playing our part, and by our resistance have contributed materially
      toward the success of the campaign. Moreover, our losses have not
      impaired our fighting efficiency. The troops have required only a slight
      respite in order to be able to continue the action with as much
      determination as ever. They are physically fit and well fed and have
      suffered merely from the fatigue which is inseparable from a protracted
      struggle such as they have been through. The severest handling by the
      enemy has never had more than a temporary effect on their spirits, which
      they have soon recovered, owing to the years of discipline and training
      to which the officers and men have been accustomed.</p>

      <p>"The value of such preparation is as noticeable on the side of the
      enemy as on our own. The phenomenal losses suffered by the Germans' new
      formations have been remarked, and they were in part due to their lack of
      training. Moreover, though at the first onset these formations advanced
      to the attack as gravely as their active corps, they have not by any
      means, shown the same recuperative powers. The Twenty-seventh Corps, for
      instance, which is a new formation composed principally of men with from
      only seven to twelve weeks' training, has not yet recovered from its
      first encounter with the British infantry around Becelaere, to the
      northeast of Ypres, a month ago. On the other hand, the Guards Corps, in
      spite of having suffered severely in Belgium, of having been thrown
      headlong across the Oise River at Guise and of having lost large numbers
      on the plains of Compi&egrave;gne and on the banks of the Aisne River,
      advanced against Ypres on the 11th of November as bravely as they did on
      the 20th of August."</p>

      <p>The Allies, continues Col. Swinton, have made great sacrifices to
      defend against tremendous odds a line that could only be maintained by
      making these sacrifices; but the fact that the situation has been
      relieved is no reason for assuming that the enemy has abandoned his
      intention of pressing through to the sea. The writer points out that the
      Germans continue to attack with great courage, but little abated by
      failure, and, while they have not succeeded in gaining the Straits of
      Dover, they have been enabled to consolidate their position on the
      western front and retain all but a small portion of Belgium.</p>

      <p>"As well as they have fought, however," continues the narrative, "it
      is doubtful if their achievements are commensurate with their losses,
      which recently have been largely due to a lack of training and a
      comparative lack of discipline of the improvised units they put in the
      field."</p>

      <p>Col. Swinton concludes with the statement that, as the war is going to
      be one of exhaustion, after the regular armies of the belligerents have
      done their work it will be upon the raw material of the countries
      concerned that final success will depend.</p>


      <h3 class="one">XIII.</h3>
      <h3 class="two">The Lull in November.</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Dated Nov. 29.]</p>

      <p>General inactivity is recorded along the English front, with the
      Germans pressing the attack in one quarter against the Indian troops, who
      have been extending their trenches in an endeavor to get in close
      quarters with the enemy. There has been some shelling of the rear of our
      front line south of the Lys, but this form of annoyance diminishes daily
      along the whole front. Sniping, however, is carried on almost
      incessantly.  There seems to be little doubt that the Germans are
      employing civilians, either willingly or unwillingly, to dig trenches;
      some civilians have been seen and shot while engaged in this work.</p>

      <p>While it is necessary to accept the evidence of all prisoners with
      caution, there is a change in the views expressed by some officers
      captured recently which appears to be genuine. They admit the failure of
      the German strategy and profess to take a gloomy view of the future. At
      the same time it must be confessed that as yet there is no sign that
      their view is that generally held by the enemy, nor has there been any
      definite indication of a lack of morale among the German troops.</p>

      <p>The highways of Northern France are crowded with men responding to the
      various mobilization orders issued by the French Government.</p>

      <p>Thousands of such troops were encountered in the course of a short
      automobile trip. The strange procession includes a curious mixture of
      types. A considerable proportion of these new drafts are composed of
      middle-aged men of good physique and likely young men from the
      countryside.</p>

      <p>The change within the last few days of what may be termed the
      atmosphere of the battlefield has been marked. The noise of the
      cannonading has now decreased to such an extent that for hours at a time
      nothing is heard but the infrequent boom of one of the heavy guns of the
      Allies, the occasional rattle of machine guns, and the intermittent fire
      of snipers on either side. So far as the use of explosives is concerned,
      the greatest activity is found in local attacks with hand grenades and
      short-range howitzers. The enemy has practically ceased his efforts to
      break through the line by assaults, and he is now devoting his energies
      to the same type of siege operations which have been familiar to the
      Allies since the beginning of the battle of the Aisne.</p>

      <p>Subterranean life is the general rule in the neighborhood of the
      firing line. Even those men not actually engaged in fighting live in
      underground quarters. Some of these quarters, called "funk-holes" are
      quite elaborate and comfortable and contain many conveniences not found
      in the trenches on the firing line. They communicate with the firing line
      by zigzag approach trenches which make enfilading impossible.</p>

      <p>Attacks are made on the firing line trenches by blind saps, which are
      constructed by a special earth borer. When this secret tunnel reaches the
      enemy's trench, an assault is delivered amid a shower of hand grenades.
      The stormers endeavor to burst their way through the opening and then try
      to work along the trench. Machine guns are quickly brought up to repel a
      counter attack. Most of this fighting takes place at such close range
      that the guns on either side cannot be fired at the enemy's infantry
      without great risk of hitting their own men. Bombs have come to take the
      place of artillery, and they are being used in enormous quantities.</p>

      <p>The short-range howitzers are of three types, and those used by the
      Germans have come to be termed the "Jack Johnson" of close attack. The
      smaller bombs and grenades thrown by hand, although local in action, are
      very unpleasant, particularly between the inclosed space of a trench.
      These grenades are thrown continuously by both sides, and every trench
      assault is first preceded and then accompanied by showers of these
      murderous missiles. This kind of fighting is very deadly, and owing to
      the difficulty of observation it is at times somewhat blind. This
      difficulty has in a measure been decreased, however, by the use of the
      hyperscope, an instrument which works very much like the periscope on a
      submarine. It permits an observer to look out over the top of a parapet
      without raising his head above the protection of the trench.</p>

      <h3>The German Entry Into Brussels</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By John Boon of The London Daily Mail.</b></p>

      <p class="right">BRUSSELS, via Alost, Aug. 20. (Thursday,) 10 P.M.</p>

      <p>The Germans entered Brussels shortly after 2 P.M. today without firing
      a shot.</p>

      <p>Yielding to the dictates of reason and humanity, the civil Government
      at the last moment disbanded the Civic Guard, which the Germans would not
      recognize. The soldiers and ordinary police were then entrusted with the
      maintenance of order.</p>

      <p>After a day of wild panic and slumberless nights the citizens remained
      at their windows. Few sought their couches.</p>

      <p>The morning broke brilliantly. The city was astir early, and on all
      lips were the words: "They are here" or "They are coming!"</p>

      <p>The "they" referred to were already outside the boundaries in great
      force. The artillery was packed off on the road to Waterloo. Horse, foot,
      and sapper were packed deep on the Louvain and Tervervueren roads.</p>

      <p>An enterprising motorist came in with the information and the crowds
      in the busy centres immediately became calm. At 11 o'clock it was
      reported that an officer with half a troop of hussars bearing white flags
      had halted outside the Louvain gate.</p>

      <p>The Burgomaster and four Sheriffs went in a motor car to meet the
      officers. They were conducted to the German military authorities at the
      head of the column. The meeting took place outside the barracks of the
      carabineers.</p>

      <p>The Burgomaster claimed for the citizens their rights under the laws
      of war regulating an unfortified capital. When roughly asked if he was
      prepared to surrender the city, with the threat that otherwise it would
      be bombarded, the Burgomaster said he would do so. He also decided to
      remove his scarf of office.</p>

      <p>The discussion was brief. When the Burgomaster handed over his scarf
      it was handed back to him and he was thus intrusted for the time being
      with the civil control of the citizens. The Germans gave him plainly to
      understand that he would be held responsible for any overt act on the
      part of the populace against the Germans.</p>

      <p>From noon until 2 o'clock the crowds waited expectantly. Shortly after
      2 o'clock the booming of cannon and later the sound of military music
      conveyed to the people of Brussels the intimation that the triumphant
      march of the enemy on the ancient city had begun.</p>

      <p>On they came, preceded by a scouting party of Uhlans, horse, foot, and
      artillery and sappers, with a siege train complete.</p>

      <p>A special feature of the procession was 100 motor cars on which
      quick-firers were mounted. Every regiment and battery was headed by a
      band, horse or foot.</p>

      <p>Now came the drums and fifes, now the blare of brass and soldiers
      singing "Die Wacht am Rhein" and "Deutschland Ueber Alles."</p>

      <p>Along the Chaussee de Louvain, past St. Josse and the Botanical
      Gardens, to the great open space in front of the Gare du Nord, the usual
      lounging place of the tired twaddlers of the city, swept the legions of
      the man who broke the peace of Europe.</p>

      <p>Among the cavalry were the famous Brunswick Death's Head Hussars and
      their companions on many bloody fields, the Zeiten Hussars. But where was
      the glorious garb of the German troops, the cherry-colored uniforms of
      the horsemen and the blue of the infantry? All is greenish, earth-color
      gray. All the hel- [<i>Transcriber: Text missing in original.</i>] are
      painted gray. The gun carriages are gray. Even the pontoon bridges are
      gray.</p>

      <p>To the quick-step beat of the drums the Kaiser's men march to the
      great Square Charles Rogier. Then at the whistling sound of the word of
      command&mdash;for the sonorous orders of the German officers seemed to
      have gone the way of the brilliant uniforms&mdash;the gray-clad ranks
      broke into the famous goose step, while the good people of Li&eacute;ge
      and Brussels gazed at the passing wonder with mouths agape.</p>

      <p>At the railroad station the great procession defiled to the boulevards
      and thence marched to encamp on the heights of the city called
      Kochelberg. It was truly a sight to have gladdened the eyes of the
      Kaiser, but on the sidewalks men were muttering beneath their breath:
      "They'll not pass here on their return. The Allies will do for them."</p>

      <p>Many of the younger men in the great array seemed exhausted after the
      long forced march, but as a man staggered his comrades in the ranks held
      him up.</p>

      <p>It was a great spectacle and an impressive one, but there were minor
      incidents that were of a less pleasant character.</p>

      <p>Two Belgian officers, manacled and fastened to the leather stirrups of
      two Uhlans, made a spectacle that caused a low murmur of resentment from
      the citizens. Instantly German horsemen backed their steeds into the
      closely packed ranks of the spectators, threatening them with uplifted
      swords and stilling the momentary revolt.</p>

      <p>At one point of the march a lame hawker offered flowers for sale to
      the soldiers. As he held up his posies a Captain of Hussars by a movement
      of his steed sent the poor wretch sprawling and bleeding in the dust.
      Then from the crowd a Frenchwoman, her heart scorning fear, cried out,
      "You brute!" so that all might hear.</p>

      <p>There was one gross pleasantry, too, perpetrated by a gunner who led
      along a bear, evidently the pet of his battery, which was dressed in the
      full regalia of a Belgian General.</p>

      <p>The bear was evidently intended to represent the King. He touched his
      cocked hat at intervals to his keeper.</p>

      <p>This particularly irritated the Belgians, but they wisely abstained
      from any overt manifestation or any unpleasant feature of behavior. The
      soldiery as they passed tore repeatedly at the national colors which
      every Belgian lady now wears on her breast.</p>

      <p>A more pleasant incident was when a party of Uhlans clamored for
      admittance at a villa on the Louvain road. They disposed of a dozen
      bottles of wine and bread and meat. The non-commissioned officer in
      command asked what the charge was and offered some gold pieces in
      payment. The money was refused.</p>

      <p>Near the steps of St. Gudule a party of officers of high rank, seated
      in a motor car, confiscated the stock of the news vendors. After greedily
      scanning the sheets they burst into loud laughter.</p>

      <p>Hour after hour, hour after hour, the Kaiser's legions marched into
      Brussels streets and boulevards. Some regiments made a very fine
      appearance, and it is well that the people of England should know this.
      It was notably so in the case of the Sixty-sixth, Fourth and Twenty-sixth
      Regiments. Not one man of these regiments showed any sign of excessive
      fatigue after the gruelling night of marching, and no doubt the order to
      "goose step" was designedly given to impress the onlookers with the
      powers of resistance of the German soldiers.</p>

      <p>The railway stations, the Post Office and the Town Hall were at once
      closed. The national flag on the latter was pulled down and the German
      emblem hoisted in its place. Practically all the shops were closed and
      the blinds drawn on most of the windows.</p>

      <p>At the time of writing I have heard of no very untoward incident. The
      last train left Brussels at 9 o'clock on Wednesday night. Passengers to
      the city cannot pass beyond Denderleeuw, where there are strong German
      pickets.</p>


      <h3>The Fall of Antwerp</h3>

      <p class="h3"><b>By a Correspondent of The London Daily Chronicle, Who Was
         at Antwerp During the Siege.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[Special Dispatch to <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span>.]</p>

      <p>LONDON, Oct. 11.&mdash;A Daily Chronicle correspondent who has just
      arrived from Antwerp tells the following story of his experiences:</p>

      <p>Antwerp has been surrendered. This last and bitterest blow which has
      fallen upon Belgium is full of poignant tragedy, but the tragedy is
      lightened by the gallantry with which the city was defended.</p>

      <p>Only at the last, to save the historic buildings and precious
      possessions of the ancient port, was its further defense abandoned.
      Already much of it had been shattered by the long-range German guns, and
      prolonged resistance against these tremendous engines of war was
      impossible.</p>

      <p>Owing to this the siege was perhaps the shortest in the annals of war
      that a fortified city ever sustained. I have already described its
      preliminaries and the many heroic efforts which were made by the Belgians
      to stem the tide of the enemy's advance, but the end could not long be
      delayed when the siege guns began the bombardment.</p>

      <p>It was at three minutes past noon on Friday that the Germans entered
      the city, which was formally surrendered by the Burgomaster, J. de Vos.
      Antwerp had then been under a devastating and continuous shell fire for
      over forty hours.</p>

      <p>It was difficult for me to ascertain precisely how the German attack
      was being constituted, but from officers and others who made journeys
      from the fighting lines into the city I gathered that the final assault
      consisted of a continuous bombardment of two hours' duration, from 7:30
      o'clock in the morning until 9:30.</p>

      <p>During that time there was a continuous rain of shells, and it was
      extraordinary to notice the precision with which they dropped just where
      they would do the most damage. I was told that the Germans used captive
      balloons, whose officers signaled to the gunners the points in the
      Belgian defense at which they should aim.</p>

      <p>The German guns, too, were concealed with such cleverness that their
      position could not be detected by the Belgians. Against such methods and
      against the terrible power of the German guns the Belgian artillery
      seemed quite ineffective. The firing came to an end at 9:30 o'clock
      Friday, and the garrison escaped, leaving only ruins behind them.</p>

      <p>In order to gain time for an orderly retreat, a heavy fire was
      maintained against the Germans up to the last minute, and the forts were
      then blown up by the defenders as the Germans came in at the Gate of
      Malines. I was lucky enough to escape by the river to the north in a
      motor boat. The bombardment had then ceased, though many buildings were
      still blazing, and while the little boat sped down the Scheldt one could
      imagine the procession of the Kaiser's troops already goose-stepping
      their way through the well-nigh deserted streets.</p>

      <p>Those forty hours of shattering noise, almost without a lull, seem to
      me now a fantastic nightmare, but the harrowing sights I witnessed in
      many parts of the city cannot be forgotten. It was Wednesday night that
      the shells began to fall into the city. From then onward they must have
      averaged about ten a minute, and most of them came from the largest guns
      which the Germans possess&mdash;"Black Marias," as Tommy Atkins has
      christened them.</p>

      <p>Before the bombardment had been long in operation the civil population
      or a large proportion of it fell into a panic. It is impossible to blame
      these peaceful, quiet living burghers of Antwerp for the fears that
      possessed them when the merciless rain of German shells began to fall
      into the streets and on the roofs of their houses and public buildings.
      The Burgomaster had in his proclamation given them excellent advice to
      remain calm and he certainly set them an admirable example, but it was
      impossible to counsel the Belgians who knew what had happened to their
      fellow citizens in other towns which the Germans had passed through.</p>

      <p>Immense crowds of them, men, women and children, gathered along the
      quayside and at the railway stations in an effort to make a hasty exit
      from the city. Their condition was pitiable in the extreme. Family
      parties made up the biggest proportion of this vast crowd of broken men
      and women. There were husbands and wives with their groups of scared
      children unable to understand what was happening, yet dimly conscious in
      their childish way that something unusual and terrible and perilous had
      come into their lives.</p>

      <p>In many groups were to be seen old, old people, grandfathers and
      grandmothers of a family, and these in their shaking frailty and terror,
      which they could not withstand, were the more pitiable objects in the
      great gathering of stricken townsfolk. This pathetic clinging together of
      the family was one of the most affecting sights I witnessed, and I have
      not the slightest doubt that in the mad rush for refuge beyond the
      borders of their native land many family groups of this sort completely
      perished.</p>

      <p>All day and throughout the night these pitiful scenes continued, and
      when I went down to the quayside early Thursday, when the dawn was
      throwing a wan light over this part of the world, I found again a great
      host of citizens awaiting their chance of flight.</p>

      <p>In the dimness of the breaking day this gathering of "Les
      Mis&eacute;rables" presented, as it seemed to me, the tragedy of Belgium
      in all its horror.  I shall never forget the sight. Words would fail to
      convey anything but a feeble picture of the depths of misery and despair
      there. People stood in dumb and patient ranks drawn down to the quayside
      by the announcement that two boats would leave at 11 o'clock for Ostend,
      and Ostend looks across to England, where lie their hopes.</p>

      <p>There were fully 40,000 of them assembled on the long quay, and all of
      them were inspired by the sure and certain hope that they would be among
      the lucky ones who would get on board one of the boats. Alas for their
      hopes, the two boats did not sail, and when they realized this I fancied
      I heard a low wail of anguish rise from the disappointed multitude.</p>

      <p>Other means of escape were, however, available in the shape of a dozen
      or fifteen tugboats, whose destinations were Rotterdam and Flushing and
      other ports of Holland. They were not vessels of any considerable
      passenger carrying capacity, and as there was no one to arrange a
      systematic embarkation a wild struggle followed among the frantic people
      to obtain places on the tugs. Men, women, and children fought desperately
      with each other to get on board, and in that moment of supreme anguish
      human nature was seen in one of its worst moods, but who can blame these
      stricken people? Shells that were destroying their homes and giving their
      beloved town to the flames were screaming over their heads. Their trade
      was not war; they were merchants, shopkeepers, comfortable citizens of
      more than middle age, and there were many women and children among them,
      and this horror had come upon them in a more appalling shape than it has
      visited any other civilized community in modern times.</p>

      <p>There was a scarcity of gangways to the boats and the only means of
      boarding them was by narrow planks sloping at a dangerous angle. Up these
      the fugitives struggled, and the strong elbowed the weak out of their way
      in their mad haste to escape. The marvel to me as I watched the scramble
      was that many were not crushed to death in the struggle to get on board
      or forced into the river and drowned. As it was, mishaps were very few.
      One old lady of 80 years slipped on one of the planks and fell against
      the side of the boat, fracturing her skull. Several people fell into the
      river and two were drowned, but that is the sum total of accidents as far
      as I could ascertain.</p>

      <p>By 2 o'clock Thursday most of the tugboats had got away, but there
      were still some 15,000 people who had not been able to escape, and had to
      await resignedly whatever fate was in store for them.</p>

      <p>I have endeavored to describe the scenes at the quayside on Thursday
      morning, and I now turn to the Central Station, where incidents of a
      similar kind were happening. There, as down by the river, an immense
      throng of people had assembled, and they were filled with dismay at the
      announcement that no trains were running. In their despair they prepared
      to leave the city on foot by crossing the pontoon bridge and marching
      toward the Dutch frontier.</p>

      <p>I cannot, of course, speak positively on the subject, but I should say
      the exodus of refugees from the city must have totaled 200,000
      persons&mdash;men, women, and children of all ages&mdash;or very nearly
      that vast number, and that out of a population which in normal times is
      321,821.  One might estimate that fully 70 per cent. of those folk had
      little or no money.</p>

      <p>There were three lines of exit. They could up to the time of the
      German invasion cross the pontoon bridge over the Scheldt; they could go
      along the countryside toward the Dutch frontier, or they could walk up
      the Scheldt toward the frontier and then cross by ferry to Belgian
      territory again.</p>

      <p>Many of the aged women among the refugees, terrorized and
      hunger-stricken, died, I am told, on the way to the Belgian frontier.
      The towns were crowded with pitiful wanderers, fleeing from the ruthless
      invaders, and they begged for crusts of bread. They were simply starving,
      and householders did what they could to help, cottagers giving to their
      utmost out of their meagre larders, but still there was a cry for
      food.</p>

      <p>I now return to the events of Thursday. At 12:30 o'clock in the
      afternoon, when the bombardment had already lasted over twelve hours,
      through the courtesy of a Belgian officer I was able to ascend to the
      roof of the cathedral, and from that point of vantage I looked down upon
      the scene in the city.</p>

      <p>All the southern portion of Antwerp appeared to be a desolate ruin.
      Whole streets were ablaze, and flames were rising in the air to the
      height of twenty and thirty feet. In another direction I could just
      discern through my glasses dimly in the distance the instruments of
      culture of the attacking German forces, ruthlessly pounding at the city
      and creeping nearer to it in the dark. At that moment I should say the
      enemy's front line was within four miles of Antwerp.</p>

      <p>From my elevated position I had an excellent view also of the great
      oil tanks on the opposite side of the Scheldt. They had been set on fire
      by four bombs from a German taube, and a huge, thick volume of black
      smoke was ascending 200 feet into the air. The oil had been burning
      furiously for several hours, and the whole neighborhood was enveloped in
      a mist of smoke.</p>

      <p>In all directions were fire and flames and oil-laden smoke. It was
      like a bit of Gustave Dor&eacute;'s idea of the infernal regions. From
      time to time great tongues of fire shot out from the tanks, and in this
      way, the flames greedily licking the sides of other tanks, the
      conflagration spread. How long this particular fire raged I cannot say,
      for I saw neither the beginning nor the end of it, but while I watched
      its progress it seemed to represent the limit of what a fire was capable
      of.</p>

      <p>After watching for some considerable time the panorama of destruction
      that lay unrolled all around me, I came down from my post of observation
      on the cathedral roof, and at the very moment I reached the street a
      28-centimeter shell struck a confectioner's shop between the Place Verte
      and the Place Meir. It was one of these high explosive shells, and the
      shop, a wooden structure, immediately burst into flames.</p>

      <p>The city by this time was almost deserted, and no attempt was made to
      extinguish the fires that had broken out all over the southern district.
      Indeed, there were no means of dealing with them.</p>

      <p>As far back as Tuesday in last week the water supply from the
      reservoir ten miles outside the city was cut off, and as this was the
      city's main source of supply, indeed practically its only source, great
      apprehension was felt. The reservoir is just behind Fort Waelhem, and the
      German shells had struck it, doing great mischief. It left Antwerp
      without any regular inflow of water, and the inhabitants had to do their
      best with artesian wells. Great efforts were made by the Belgians from
      time to time to repair the reservoir, but it was always thwarted by
      German shell fire. The health of the city was thereby menaced, for there
      was danger of an epidemic.</p>

      <p>Happily, stricken Antwerp was spared this added terror. It had plenty
      of other sorts, and some of these I experienced when, after leaving the
      cathedral, I made my way to the southern section of the city, where
      shells were bursting at the rate of five a minute. With great difficulty
      and not without risk I got as far as Rue la Moi&egrave;re.</p>

      <p>There I met a terror-stricken Belgian woman, the only other person in
      the streets besides myself. In hysterical gasps she told me the Banque
      Nationale and the Palais de Justice had been struck and were in flames,
      and that her husband had been hit by a shell just five minutes before I
      came upon the scene, his mangled remains lying not a hundred yards away
      from where we were standing.</p>

      <p>It was obviously impossible to proceed further, and so I retraced my
      steps toward the quay. As I was passing the Avenue de Keyser a shell
      burst within twenty yards of me. I was knocked down by the force of the
      concussion. A house not ten yards from where I was was struck and
      actually poured (I can think of no other word to describe what happened)
      into the street in a shower of bricks. A broken brick struck me on the
      shoulder, but its force was spent and I received no injury.</p>

      <p>I had scarcely picked myself up and was hastening to a place of
      safety, if there were one, when a man about 40 years of age, almost half
      naked, rushed out of a house, screaming loudly. He had gone mad.</p>

      <p>At this time I was fortunate enough to meet Frank Fox of The Morning
      Post. Mr. Fox is an ex-officer of artillery, and he told me he had found
      a hotel which, as long as the Germans fired in the direction they were
      then firing, was not within the reach of their guns. This was the Hotel
      Wagner, which stands behind the Opera House on the Boulevard de Commerce.
      It was the only hotel in the city except the Queens Hotel, in which some
      representatives of American newspapers had been staying, that was open.
      There I found Miss Louise Mack, an Australian authoress, and she, Fox,
      and myself were among the few British subjects left in the port.</p>

      <p>As night came the city presented a fantastic appearance as I watched
      it from the Hotel Wagner. The glare from the fires that had burst out in
      all directions could be seen for miles around. The bombardment was
      proceeding furiously, and German shells were bursting in every direction.
      I reckoned they were coming in that time at the rate of at least thirty a
      minute.</p>

      <p>I went to the Queens Hotel to ascertain what had become of the
      American journalists. I found they had left the city after having spent
      the night in a private house which had been struck three times by shells,
      and finally caught fire. Arthur Ruhl of the staff of Collier's Weekly had
      left for me this note:</p>

      <blockquote>
         <p>Donald C. Thompson, photographer of The New York World, fitted up
         for himself a cellar at 74 Rue de Peage, just by the Boulevard de
         Keyser, where shrapnel fell with terrible force during the latter part
         of Wednesday. With him were three other Americans. The entire
         population, including, of course, the Government of Antwerp, have made
         their escape across the pontoon bridge which still connects the River
         Scheldt with the road toward Ghent. Two shells demolished Thompson's
         retreat and at sundown it burst into flames. The American Consul
         General and Vice Consul General had gone by this time. The following
         Americans, all of them newspaper men, were known to have spent the
         night in Antwerp; Arthur Ruhl, Horace Green, staff of The New York
         Evening Post; Edward Eyre Hunt, correspondent of The New York World;
         Edward Heigel of the staff of The Chicago Daily Tribune, and Thompson
         himself.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Except for the glare of burning buildings, which lit up the streets,
      the city was in absolute darkness, and near the quay I lost my way in the
      byroads trying to get back to the Hotel Wagner. For the second time that
      day I narrowly escaped death by a shell. One burst with terrific force
      about twenty-five yards from me. I heard its warning whirr, and rushed
      into a neighboring porch. Whether it was from concussion of the shell or
      in my anxiety to escape, I cannoned against a door and tumbled down. As I
      lay on the ground the house on the opposite side crashed in ruins. I
      remained still for several minutes feeling quite sick and unable to get
      up. Then I pulled myself together, and ran at full speed until I came to
      a street which I recognized, and found my way back to the hotel.</p>

      <p>As I hastened down the Avenue de Keyser shells were bursting in every
      quarter. Several fell into the adjoining street. At the hotel I found my
      friend Fox had been up to the Red Cross Hospital to inquire about a motor
      car in which we hoped to get away. It had gone, as had the entire
      personnel of the hospital.</p>

      <p>We began to wonder how we should escape. However, Fox had a bicycle,
      and Mr. Singleton, Chief of the Boy Scouts in Antwerp, had given me the
      key of a house not far off, in which he told me there was one if I wanted
      it in an emergency. I ventured into that dangerous part of the city again
      to get it. I got to the house safely and found the bicycle, but as there
      was no tube in the back tire it was useless. On my return journey I was
      startled to see in the street through which I had just walked a hole six
      feet deep, which had just been made by a shell.</p>

      <p>On returning to the hotel I joined in a meal, eaten under the
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'wierdest']">weirdest</ins>
      conditions imaginable. Descending into the cellars of the hotel with Miss
      Mack and Mr. Fox we found the entire staff gathered there uncertain what
      to do and not knowing what was to happen to them. We were all hungry, and
      one of the men dashed upstairs to the kitchen and brought down whatever
      food he could lay his hands on, and we all partook of pot luck.
      Considering all the circumstances we made a very jolly meal of it. We
      toasted each other in good red wine of the country, pledging each other
      with "Vive la Belgique" and "Vive l'Angleterre," and altogether we were a
      merry party, although at the time German shells were whirling overhead
      and any moment one might have upset our picnic and buried us in the
      d&eacute;bris of the hotel.</p>

      <p>How many of the inhabitants of Antwerp remained in the city that night
      it is impossible to say, but it is pretty certain they were all in the
      cellars of their houses or shops.</p>

      <p>The admirable Burgomaster, M. De Vos, had in one of his several
      proclamations made many suggestions for safety during the bombardment for
      the benefit of those who took refuge in cellars. Among the most useful of
      them perhaps was that which recommended means of escape to adjoining
      cellars. The power of modern artillery is so tremendous that a cellar
      might very well become a tomb if shells were to fall on the building
      overhead.</p>

      <p>We went to bed early that night but sleep was impossible in the noise
      caused by the explosion of the shells in twenty different quarters of the
      town. About 3 o'clock in the morning a twenty-eight centimeter shell fell
      into the square in front of the hotel and broke all the windows in the
      neighboring house. In spite of the terrific din one got to sleep at
      last.</p>

      <p>About 6 o'clock Fox roused me and said he thought it was time we got
      out, as the Germans were entering the city. We hurried from the hotel,
      and found in the square a squad of Belgian soldiers who had just come in
      from the inner line of forts. They told us it was not safe for us to
      remain any longer. The streets were now completely deserted.</p>

      <p>I walked down to the quayside, and there I came across many wounded
      soldiers, who had been unable to get away in the hospital boat. On the
      quay piles of equipment had been abandoned; broken-down motor cars,
      kit-bags, helmets, rifles, knapsacks were littered in heaps. Ammunition
      had been dumped there and rendered useless. The Belgians had evidently
      attempted to set fire to the whole lot. A pile of stuff was still
      smoldering. I waited there for half an hour, and during that time
      hundreds of Belgian soldiers passed in retreat, the last contingent
      leaving at about 6:30 A.M.</p>

      <p>I went again to the Queen's Hotel to inquire what had become of the
      American newspaper men, and it was just about this time that the pontoon
      bridge which had been the way of the Belgian retreat was blown up to
      prevent pursuit by the Germans. The boats and woodwork of the
      superstructure burnt fiercely and in less than twenty minutes the whole
      affair was demolished.</p>

      <p>Safe exit from the city was now cut off. A Red Cross officer whom I
      met when standing by the quay had been a spectator of the blowing up of
      the bridge.</p>

      <p>"My God!" he said, running toward me, "it is awful!"</p>

      <p>"How are you going to get out?" I asked him.</p>

      <p>"I'm going to stay here and look after my wounded," he replied.</p>

      <p>In further talk with him I learned that the greater part of the second
      line of forts had fallen at midday the previous day and that there was
      nothing then to stop the Germans entering the city save a handful of
      Belgian soldiers in three or four forts. At 8 o'clock a shell struck the
      Town Hall.</p>

      <p>Fox had now joined me, and we took refuge in the cellars beneath the
      Town Hall. So far as I could gather, the remaining inhabitants of Antwerp
      must have assembled about this neighborhood, groups taking refuge in
      small and stuffy cellars, where developments were anxiously awaited.
      There must have been hundreds of people sheltered underground, and they
      included the Mexican and Dominican Consuls. Why these stayed I do not
      know, as none of their people were left behind. They were the only
      Consuls remaining in Antwerp.</p>

      <p>About 8:15 o'clock another shell struck the Town Hall, shattering the
      upper story and breaking every window in the place. That was the German
      way of telling the Burgomaster to hurry up. There was a tense feeling as
      we waited for tidings of some sort or other. A quarter of an hour later
      M. De Vos went out in his motor car toward the German line to discuss
      conditions on which the city should be surrendered.</p>

      <p>Another shell struck a furrier's shop opposite the Town Hall and the
      place burst into flames. Several of the gendarmes who had stayed behind
      were occupants of cellars, and two of them immediately rushed out to
      force a way into the shop in order that they might extinguish the fire.
      They found the door locked. It took them ten minutes to force an
      entrance. By this time the fire was burning fiercely, and at great
      personal risk one of the gendarmes made his way to the top floor of the
      premises, and there he endeavored to beat out the flames with a piece of
      timber torn from the roof. His efforts were futile, and he called for
      water. Soon a Flemish woman brought him two pailfuls, which Fox had
      carried to the house, and after half an hour's labor the fire was
      extinguished.</p>

      <p>The proprietor of the shop was among the people in the cellars across
      the way. The news that his house was aflame was broken to him and he
      rushed into the street. He gazed for a moment on the scene and burst into
      tears like a child.</p>

      <p>At 9 o'clock the bombardment of the city suddenly ceased and we
      understood the Burgomaster had by this time reached German headquarters.
      Still we waited, painfully anxious to learn what would be the ultimate
      fate of Antwerp. The Belgian soldiers hurried by on their way to the
      front. A number paused just as they reached a tobacconist's shop which
      had been wrecked by shells, scattering the stock in the street. There
      were cigars hurled across the pavement and roadway, and soldiers who had
      halted picked up a few of the cigars. A Belgian workman, taking advantage
      of this, entered the shop and began to stuff his pockets full of cigars
      and cigarettes, but immediately gendarmes hurried to the place and
      arrested him, the last arrest the Antwerp police will make for some
      time.</p>

      <p>At 10:30 o'clock proclamations were posted on walls of the Town Hall
      urging all in the city to surrender any arms in their possession and
      begging for a calm demeanor in the event of German occupation. The list
      was also posted of several prominent citizens who were appointed to look
      after the interests of those Belgians who remained.</p>

      <p>Just before noon a patrol of cyclists and armed and mounted gendarmes,
      who had escorted the Burgomaster to the gate of the city, informed Fox
      and myself that the Germans were entering by the gate of Malines. We
      hastily took our bicycles with the intention of making our way over the
      Dutch frontier. As we passed along the quay by a most timely stroke of
      luck we found a motor boat standing by. It was manned by a Belgian, and
      his mate.</p>

      <p>"Can you take us to Flushing?" we asked.</p>

      <p>"Yes," answered the Belgian.</p>

      <p>"How much?"</p>

      <p>"One hundred and fifty francs each."</p>

      <p>We were in that boat in thirty seconds and in another thirty seconds
      had started down the Scheldt. By this time the Germans were in the
      city.</p>

      <p>At a good ten knots we raced down the river. In twenty-five minutes we
      had reached the bend which blotted Antwerp from view. As we rounded the
      corner I turned for a last glimpse of the disappearing city. The
      Cathedral was still standing, its tower dominating surroundings. Here and
      there volumes of smoke were rising to the sky.</p>

      <p>It took us twelve hours to get to Flushing. On either side of the
      river thousands of refugees were fleeing from the invaders. They swarmed
      along the banks in continuous lines, a vast pilgrimage of the hopeless,
      many laden with household possessions which they had been able to gather
      at almost a moment's notice. Numbers were empty-handed and burdened at
      that in dragging their weary bodies along the miles which seemed never
      ending. It was a heartrending spectacle. Infinite pity must go out to
      those broken victims of the war, bowed veterans driven from home, going
      they knew not where; women with their crying children, famished for lack
      of food, all or nearly all leaving behind men folk who were still
      fighting their country's battle or mourning the loss of loved ones who
      had already sacrificed their lives.</p>

      <p>Where the Scheldt becomes Dutch property we were stopped by customs
      authorities and submitted to a rigorous examination. Dutch officials for
      a time believed we were either Belgian or English officers escaping, but
      eventually they were satisfied.</p>

      <p>Upon arriving at Flushing we found the town in a tremendous state of
      excitement. Great crowds of refugees were there, 10,000 or more, and the
      hotels were choked. Many wretched people had left their homes absolutely
      without any money and were forced to camp in the streets.  There was a
      vast crowd waiting to get on the Flushing-Folkestone boat, and it
      appeared we would be balked in our endeavor to get to England that night.
      However, we discussed our position with the Superintendent of the line,
      and he very kindly got us a berth.</p>


      <h3>As the French Fell Back on Paris</h3>

      <p><ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'CHATEAU']">CH&Acirc;TEAU</ins>
      THIERRY, Sunday, Sept. 13.&mdash;We first realized yesterday, in a little town
      of Brie which lies east of Paris, between the Seine and the Marne, how
      difficult it is to get food in the rear of two successive invasions. As
      in every other town in the region, all the shops were shut and nearly all
      the houses. It was only after a long search that we found an inn that
      could give us luncheon.</p>

      <p>There, in a large room with a low-beamed roof and a tiled floor, our
      stout landlady in blue cotton produced an excellent meal of melon,
      mutton, macaroni, and good ripe pears. Dogs and cats sprawled around us,
      and a big bowl of roses spoke of serenities that are now in general
      eclipse. At a neighboring table a group of peasants, too old for active
      service, were discussing their grievances.</p>

      <p>At a railway crossing just out of town we were blocked by a train of
      about a dozen big horse trucks and two passenger carriages, carrying
      wounded and prisoners to Paris from the fighting lines in the north. It
      had been a gloomy morning, and the rain now fell in torrents.
      Nevertheless the townsfolk crowded up, and for half an hour managed to
      conduct a satisfactory combination of profit and pity by supplying big
      flat loaves, bottles of wine, fruit, cigarettes, and jugs of water to
      those in the train who had money and some who had none. One very old
      woman in white, with a little red cross on her forehead, turned up to
      take advantage of the only opportunity ever likely to fall in her way. A
      great Turco in fez, blouse, and short, baggy breeches was very active in
      this commissariat work.</p>

      <p>Some of the Frenchmen on board were not wounded seriously enough to
      prevent their getting down on the roadway; and you may be sure they were
      not ashamed of their plaster patches and bandaged arms.</p>

      <p>There were about 300 German prisoners in the train. We got glimpses of
      them lying in the straw on the floor in the dark interior of the big
      trucks. I got on the footboard and looked into the open door of one car.
      Fifteen men were stretched upon straw, and two soldiers stood guard over
      them, rifle in hand. They all seemed in a state of extreme exhaustion.
      Some were asleep, others were eating large chunks of bread.</p>

      <p>In the middle of the car a young soldier who spoke French fairly well
      told me that the German losses during the last three days had been
      enormous; and then, stopping suddenly, he said:</p>

      <p>"Would it be possible, Sir, to get a little water for my fellows and
      myself?"</p>

      <p>"Certainly," I replied; and a man belonging to the station, who was
      passing with a jug, said at once that he would run and get some. The
      prisoner thanked me and added with a sigh:</p>

      <p>"They are very good fellows here."</p>

      <p>One jocular French guard had put on a spiked helmet which he was
      keeping as a trophy, and, so much does the habit make the man, he now
      looked uncannily like a German himself.</p>

      <p>As we passed through the villages to the northeast the contrast
      between abandoned houses and gardens rioting with the color of roses and
      dahlias and fruit-laden trees struck us like a blow.</p>

      <p>In Gourchamp a number of houses had been burned, and the neighboring
      fields showed that there had been fighting there; but it was Courtacon
      which presented the most grievous spectacle. Eighteen of its two dozen
      houses had been completely destroyed by fire. The walls were partly
      standing, but the floors and contents of the rooms were completely buried
      under the d&eacute;bris of roofs that had fallen in. In a little Post
      Office the telegraphic and telephonic instruments had been smashed. Just
      opposite is a small building including the office of the Mayor and the
      village school. The outside of the building and the outhouses were
      littered with the straw on which the Uhlans had slept. In the Mayor's
      office the drawers and cupboards had been broken open, and their contents
      had been scattered with the remnants of meals on the floor.</p>

      <p>But it is a scene in a little village school that will longest remain
      in my memory. The low forms, the master's desk, and the blackboard stand
      today as they did on July 25, which was no doubt the last day before the
      Summer vacation, as it was also the last week before the outbreak of the
      war. On the walls the charts remained which reminded these little ones
      daily that "Alcohol is the enemy," and had summoned them to follow the
      path of kindness, justice, and truth. The windows were smashed, broken
      cartridge cases lay about with wings of birds and other refuse. Near the
      door I saw chalked up, evidently in German handwriting, "Parti Paris,"
      ("Left for Paris.")</p>

      <p>The invaders had sought to burn the place. There was one pile of
      partly burned straw under the school bookcase, the doors of which had
      been smashed, while some of the books had been thrown about. They had not
      even respected a little museum consisting of a few bottles of metal and
      chemical specimens; and when I turned to leave I perceived written across
      the blackboard in bold, fine writing, as the lesson of the day, these
      words: "A chaque jour suffit sa peine," ("Sufficient unto the day is the
      evil thereof.")</p>

      <p>One of the villagers gave us the following narrative of the
      experiences of the past week:</p>

      <p>"It was last Saturday, Sept. 5, that about 15,000 Uhlans arrived in
      the village with the intention of marching on Provins on the morrow. They
      probably learned during the night that the British and French lay in
      force across their road, and perhaps they may now have received orders to
      fall back.</p>

      <p>"At any rate, early Sunday morning they started to retire, when they
      met at the entrance to the village a regiment of chasseurs. This was the
      beginning of fighting which lasted all day. Under the pretext that we had
      learned of the presence of the French troops and had helped them to
      prepare a trap, the Germans sacked the whole of the village.</p>

      <p>"Naturally there was a panic. All the inhabitants&mdash;mostly women
      and children, because since the mobilization there have been only nine
      men in Courtacon&mdash;rushed from their cottages and many of them,
      lightly clad, fled across the fields and hid themselves in the
      neighboring woods.</p>

      <p>"In several cottages Germans, revolvers in hand, compelled the poor
      peasants to bring matches and themselves set fire to their homes. In less
      than an hour the village was like a furnace, the walls toppling down one
      by one. And all this time the fighting continued. It was a horrible
      spectacle.</p>

      <p>"Several of us were dragged to the edge of the road to be shot, and
      there we remained for some hours, believing our last day had come. A
      young village lad of 21 years, who was just going to leave to join the
      colors, was shot. Then the retreat was sounded, the Germans fled
      precipitately, and we were saved."</p>

      <p>I asked whether the cottages had not been fired by artillery.</p>

      <p>"Not a cannon shot fell here," he replied. "All that"&mdash;pointing
      to the ruined huts&mdash;"was done by incendiaries." And then he
      added:</p>

      <p>"Last Tuesday two French officers came in automobiles and brought with
      them a superior German officer whom they had made prisoner. They
      compelled him to become a witness of the mischief of which his
      fellow-countrymen had been guilty."</p>

      <p>A peasant woman passed, pushing a wheelbarrow containing some
      half-burned household goods and followed by her two small children.</p>

      <p>"Look," she said, "at the brutality of these Germans! My husband has
      gone to war and I am alone with my two little ones. With great difficulty
      we had managed to gather our crop, and they set fire to our little farm
      and burned everything."</p>

      <p>Half an hour later we were at La Fert&eacute; Gaucher, a small town on
      the Grand Morin, now first made famous by the fact that it was here that
      the German flight began after the severe fighting last Monday. The
      invaders had arrived only on Saturday and had the disagreeable surprise
      of finding that the river bridges had been broken down by the retreating
      French. The German commandant informed the municipal officials that if
      the sum of 60,000 francs ($12,000) was not produced he would burn the
      town. Then he compelled the people to set about rebuilding the bridge,
      and they worked day and night at this job under the eyes of soldiers with
      revolvers and rifles ready to shoot down any shirker.</p>

      <p>The relief of these people at the return of the Allies may be
      imagined.  Here, as elsewhere, some houses were burned, but otherwise the
      damage did not appear to be very serious.</p>

      <p>NEAR AMIENS, Aug. 30.&mdash;Looking back on all I have seen during the
      last few days, I find it difficult to piece together the various
      incidents and impressions and to make one picture. It all seems to me now
      like a jigsaw puzzle of suffering and fear and courage and death&mdash;a
      litter of odd, disconnected scraps of human agony and of some big, grim
      scheme which, if one could only get the clue, would give a meaning, I
      suppose, to all these tears of women and children, to all these hurried
      movements of soldiers and people, to the death carts trailing back from
      unknown places, and to the great dark fear that has enveloped all the
      tract of country in Northwest France through which I have been traveling,
      driven like one of its victims from place to place.  Out of all this
      welter of individual suffering and from all the fog of mystery which has
      enshrouded them until now, when the truth may be told, certain big facts
      with a clear and simple issue will emerge and give one courage.</p>

      <p>The French Army and our English troops are now holding good positions
      in a much stronger and closer line and stemming the tide of the German
      hordes rolling up to Paris. Gen. Pau, the hero of this war, after his
      swift return from the eastern front, where he repaired the deadly check
      at M&uuml;lhausen, has dealt a smashing blow at a German Army corps which
      was striking to the heart of France.</p>

      <p>Paris is still safe for the time being, with a great army of allied
      forces, French, English, and Belgians, drawn across the country as a
      barrier which surely will not be broken by the enemy. Nothing that has
      happened gives cause for that despair which has taken hold of people
      whose fears have exaggerated the facts, frightful enough when taken
      separately, but not giving any proof that resistance is impossible
      against the amazing onslaught of the German legions.</p>

      <p>I have been into the war zone and seen during the last five days men
      who are now holding the lines of defense. I have been among their dead
      and wounded, and have talked with soldiers marching fresh to the front. I
      have seen the horrid mess which is cleared up after the battle and the
      grim picture of retreat, but nothing that I have seen or heard from
      either British or French leads me to believe that our army has been
      smashed or the Allies demoralized.</p>

      <p>It is impossible to estimate our own losses. Our wounded are being
      brought back into Havre and Rouen, and undoubtedly there are large
      numbers of them. But, putting them at the highest, it is clear to me,
      from all information gained during the last five days, that there has
      been no overwhelming disaster, and that in the terrible actions fought on
      the four days from the 23d to the 27th, and afterward in the further
      retirement from the line of Cambrai and Le Cateau, swinging southward and
      eastward upon St. Quentin, our main forces, which were pressed by
      enormous numbers of the enemy, succeeded in withdrawing in good order,
      without having their lines broken, while inflicting a terrific punishment
      upon the German right.</p>

      <p>As I shall show in this narrative, retreats which seem fatal when seen
      close at hand and when described by those who belong to broken fragments
      of extended sections, are not altogether disastrous in their effect when
      viewed in their right perspective, away from the immediate misery which
      is their inevitable accompaniment.</p>

      <p>German audacity of attack against the heroic courage of the French and
      British forces, who fight every mile of ground during their retirement,
      is leading the enemy into a position from which there will be no retreat
      if their lines are broken. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands
      of people who know nothing of the great issues and who are possessed by
      the great, blind fear which has driven them from their towns, villages,
      and homes.</p>

      <p>When the Germans swept around Lille they found, to their amazement,
      that this town, surrounded by forts, had been abandoned, and they had
      only to walk inside. This easy access to a town which should have been
      defended to the last gasp opened the way to the west of France.</p>

      <p>The left wing of the French, which was to the west of Mons, was
      supported by the English troops, all too weak to sustain the pressure of
      the tremendous odds which began to surge against them; and, realizing
      this perilous state of affairs, the brain at the centre of things, the
      controlling brain of Gen. Joffre and his Headquarters Staff, decreed that
      the northwest corner of France was untenable and that the main army of
      defense should withdraw into a stronger and closer formation.</p>

      <p>It was then that the great panic began, increasing in speed and terror
      during the end of last week. I was in the midst of it and saw
      unforgettable scenes of the enormous tragedy. It was a flight of hundreds
      and thousands of families from St. Omer and Roubaix, Bethune, Douai,
      Valenciennes, and Arras, who were driven away from their northern homes
      by the menace of approaching Uhlans. They are still being hunted by fear
      from place to place, where they can find no shelter and no permanent
      safety. The railways have been choked with them, and in these long
      fugitive trains which pass through stations there is no food or drink.
      The poor runaways, weary, filthy, and exhausted, spend long days and
      nights shunted onto side lines, while troop trains pass and pass, and are
      held up in towns where they can find no means of existence because the
      last civilian train has left.</p>

      <p>When the troops marched away from Boulogne and left it silent and
      unguarded I saw the inhabitants, utterly dismayed, standing despondently
      staring at placards posted up by order of the Governor, which announced
      the evacuation of the town and called upon them to be ready for all
      sacrifices in the service of their country. The customs officers left,
      the civil police disarmed, while a flag with nine black spots was made
      ready to be hoisted on the fort directly any Uhlans were sighted.</p>

      <p>The people of Boulogne could not understand, no Frenchman of the north
      can understand, why their ports and towns are silent after the tramp of
      so many regiments who have left a great tract of country open and
      undefended. In that corner of France the people listen intently for the
      first clatter of hoofs and for the first cry "Les Uhlans." Rumors came
      that the enemy has been seen in neighboring towns and villages. Can one
      wonder that mothers and fathers rush from their houses and wander forth
      in a blind, unreasoning way to swell the panic tide of fugitives,
      homeless and without food, dropping here and there on the wayside in
      utter weariness?</p>

      <p>I was lucky in getting out of Boulogne on the last train bound for
      Paris, though not guaranteed to reach the capital. As a matter of fact, I
      was even more lucky because it did not arrive at its destination and
      enabled me to alight in the war zone and proceed to more interesting
      places.</p>

      <p>I will tell at once the story of the French retirement when the
      Germans advanced from Namur down the valley of the Meuse, winning the way
      at a cost of human life as great as that of defeat, yet winning their
      way.  For France the story of that retirement is as glorious as anything
      in her history. It was nearly a fortnight ago that the Germans
      concentrated their heaviest forces upon Namur and began to press
      southward and over the Meuse Valley. After the battle of Dinant the
      French Army, among whom were the Second and Seventh Corps, was heavily
      outnumbered and had to fall back gradually, in order to gain time for
      reinforcements to come up.</p>

      <p>French artillery was up on the wooded heights above the river and
      swept the German regiments with a storm of fire as they advanced. On the
      right bank the French infantry was intrenched, supported by field guns
      and mitrailleuses, and did deadly work before leaping from trenches which
      they occupied and taking up a position in new trenches further back,
      which they held with great tenacity.</p>

      <p>In justice to the Germans it must be said they were heroic in courage
      and reckless of their lives, and the valley of the Meuse was choked with
      their corpses. The river itself was strewn with the dead bodies of men
      and horses and literally ran red with blood.</p>

      <p>The most tremendous fighting took place for the possession of the
      bridges, but the French engineers blew them up one after another as they
      retired southward.</p>

      <p>No less than thirty-three bridges were destroyed in this way before
      they could be seized by the German advance guard. The fighting was
      extended for a considerable distance on either side of the Meuse and many
      engagements took place between French and German cavalry and regiments
      working away from the main armies.</p>

      <p>There was, for instance, a memorable encounter at Marville which is
      one of the most heroic episodes of the war. Five thousand French soldiers
      of all arms, with quick-firers, engaged 20,000 German infantry. In spite
      of being outnumbered, the French beat back the enemy from point to point
      in a fight lasting for twelve hours, inflicting tremendous punishment and
      suffering very few losses.</p>

      <p>The German officer captured expressed his unbounded admiration for the
      valor of the French troops, which he described as superb. It was only for
      fear of getting too far out of touch with the main forces that the
      gallant 5,000 desisted from their irresistible attack and retired with a
      large number of German helmets as trophies of the victorious action.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, in accordance with the general plan which had been
      decided on by the Generals, in view of the superior numbers temporarily
      pressing upon them, the Germans succeeded in forcing their way steadily
      down the Meuse as far as Mezi&egrave;res, divided by a bridge from
      Charleville, on the other side of the river. This is in the neighborhood
      of Sedan and in the "trou," as it is called, which led to the great
      disaster of 1870, when the French were caught in a trap and threatened
      with annihilation by the Germans, who had taken possession of the
      surrounding heights.</p>

      <p>There was to be no repetition of that tragedy. The French were
      determined that this time the position should be reversed.</p>

      <p>On Monday the town of Charleville was evacuated, most of its civilians
      being sent away to join the wanderers who have had to leave their homes,
      and the French troops took up a magnificent position, commanding the town
      and the three bridges dividing them from Mezi&egrave;res. Mitrailleuses
      were hidden in the abandoned houses, and as a disagreeable shock to any
      German who might escape their fire was a number of the enemy's guns, no
      fewer than ninety-five of them, which had been captured and disabled by
      French troops in a series of battles down the river from Namur.</p>

      <p>The German outposts reached Charleville on Tuesday. They were allowed
      to ride quietly across the bridges into an apparently deserted town. Then
      suddenly their line of retreat was cut off, the three bridges were blown
      up by a contact mine, and the mitrailleuses hidden in the houses were
      played on the German cavalry across the streets, killing them in a
      frightful slaughter.</p>

      <p>It was for a little while sheer massacre, but the Germans fought with
      extraordinary tenacity, regardless of the heaped bodies of comrades and
      utterly reckless of their own lives. They, too, had brought quick-firers
      across the bridges, and, taking cover behind houses, trained their guns
      upon the houses from which the French gunners were firing. There was no
      way of escape for those heroic men, who voluntarily sacrificed
      themselves, and it is probable every man died, because at such a time the
      Germans were not in the habit of giving quarter.</p>

      <p>When the main German advance came down the valley, the French
      artillery on the heights raked them with a terrific fire, in which they
      suffered heavy losses, the forefront of the column being mowed down. But
      under this storm they proceeded with incredible coolness to their pontoon
      bridges across the river, and although hundreds of men died on the banks,
      they succeeded in their endeavor, while their guns searched the hills
      with shells and forced French gunners to retire from their positions.</p>

      <p>The occupation of Charleville was a German victory, but was also a
      German graveyard. After this historic episode in what has been an
      unending battle the main body of French withdrew before the Germans, who
      were now pouring down the valley, and retired to new ground.</p>

      <p>It was a retirement which has had one advantage in spite of its
      acknowledgment of the enemy's amazing pertinacity. It has enabled the
      allied armies to draw closer together, its firm front sweeping around in
      a crescent from Abb&eacute;ville, around south of Amiens, and thence in
      an irregular line to the eastern frontier.</p>

      <p>On the map it is at first sight a rather unhappy thing to see that
      practically the whole of France north of Amiens lies open to German
      descent from Belgium. To break up the German Army piecemeal and lure it
      to its own destruction it was almost necessary to manoeuvre it into
      precisely the position which it now occupies. The success of Gen. Pau
      shows that the allied army is taking the offensive again, and that as a
      great fighting machine it is still powerful and menacing.</p>

      <p>I must again emphasize the difficulty of grasping the significance of
      a great campaign by isolated incidents, and the danger of drawing
      important deductions from the misfortunes in one part of the field. I do
      so because I have been tempted again and again during the past few days
      to fall into similar mistakes. Perhaps in my case it was pardonable.</p>

      <p>It is impossible for the armchair reader to realize the psychological
      effect of being mixed up in the panic of a great people and the retreat
      from a battlefield.</p>

      <p>The last real fighting was taking place at a village called Bapaume
      all day Friday. It was very heavy fighting here on the left centre of the
      great army commanded by Gen. Pau, and leading to a victory which has just
      been announced officially in France.</p>

      <p>A few minutes before midnight Friday, when they came back along the
      road to Amiens, crawling back slowly in a long, dismal trail, the
      ambulance wagons laden with the dead and dying, hay carts piled high with
      saddles and accoutrements, upon which lay, immobile like men already
      dead, the spent and exhausted soldiers, they passed through the crowds of
      silent people of Amiens, who only whispered as they stared at the
      procession.  In the darkness a cuirassier, with head bent upon his chest,
      stumbled forward, leading his horse, too weak and tired to bear him.</p>

      <p>Many other men were leading poor beasts this way, and infantry
      soldiers, some with bandaged heads, clung to the backs of carts and
      wagons, and seemed asleep as they shuffled by.</p>

      <p>The light from roadside lamps gleamed upon blanched faces and glazed
      eyes, flashed into caverns of canvas-covered carts, where twisted men lay
      huddled on straw. Not a groan came from the carts, but every one knew it
      was a retreat.</p>

      <p>The carts carrying the quick and the dead rumbled by in a long convoy,
      the drooping heads of the soldiers turned neither right nor left for any
      greeting with friends.</p>

      <p>There was a hugger-mugger of uniforms, of provision carts, and with
      ambulances&mdash;it was a part of the wreckage and wastage of war; and to
      the onlookers, with the exaggeration, unconsciously, of the importance of
      the things close at hand and visible, it seemed terrible in its
      significance and an ominous reminder of 1870.</p>

      <p>Really this was an inevitable part of a serious battle, not
      necessarily a retreat from a great disaster.</p>

      <p>But more pitiful even than this drift back were scenes which followed.
      As I turned back into the town I saw thousands of boys who had been
      called to the colors and had been brought up from the country to be sent
      forward to second lines of defense.</p>

      <p>They were the reservists of the 1914 class, and many of them were
      shouting and singing, though here and there a white-faced boy tried to
      hide his tears as women from the crowd ran forward to embrace him. These
      lads were keeping up their valor by noisy demonstrations; but, having
      seen the death carts pass, I could not bear to look into the faces of
      those little ones who are following their fathers to the guns.</p>

      <p>Early next morning there was a thrill of anxiety in Amiens. Reports
      had come through that the railway line had been cut between Boulogne and
      Abbeville. There had been mysterious movements of regiments from the town
      barracks. They had moved out of Amiens, and there was a strange quietude
      in the streets. Hardly a man in uniform was to be seen in the places
      which had been filled with soldiers the day before.</p>

      <p>Only a few people realized the actual significance of this. How could
      they know that it was a part of the great plan to secure the safety of
      France? How could they realize that the town itself would be saved from
      possible bombardment by this withdrawal of the troops to positions which
      would draw the Germans into the open?</p>

      <p>The fighting on the Cambrai-Cateau line seems to have been more
      desperate even that the terrible actions at Mons and Charleroi. It was
      when the British troops had to swing around to a more southerly line to
      guard the roads to Paris, that the enemy attacked in prodigious numbers,
      and their immense superiority in machine guns did terrible work among
      officers and men.</p>

      <p>But on all sides, from the French officers, there is immense praise
      for the magnificent conduct of our troops, and in spite of all alarmist
      statements I am convinced from what I have heard that they have retired
      intact, keeping their lines together, and preventing their divisions from
      being broken and cut off.</p>

      <p>The list of casualties must be very great, but if I can believe the
      evidence of my own eyes in such towns as Rouen, where the Red Cross
      hospitals are concentrated, they are not heavy enough to suggest anything
      like a great and irretrievable disaster.</p>

      <p>DIEPPE, Sept. 3.&mdash;Let me describe briefly the facts which I have
      learned of in the last five days. When I escaped from Amiens, before the
      tunnel was broken up, and the Germans entered into possession of the town
      on Aug. 28, the front of the allied armies was in a crescent from
      Abb&eacute;ville, south of Amiens on the wooded heights, and thence in an
      irregular line to south of M&eacute;zi&egrave;res. The British forces,
      under Sir John French, were at the left of the centre, supporting the
      heavy thrust-forward of the main German advance, while the right was
      commanded by Gen. Pau.</p>

      <p>On Sunday afternoon fighting was resumed along the whole line. The
      German vanguard had by this time been supported by a fresh army corps,
      which had been brought from Belgium. At least 1,000,000 men were on the
      move, pressing upon the allied forces with a ferocity of attack which has
      never before been equaled. Their cavalry swept across a great tract of
      country, squadron by squadron, like the mounted hordes of Attila, but
      armed with the dreadful weapons of modern warfare. Their artillery was in
      enormous numbers, and their columns advanced under cover of it, not like
      an army, but rather like a moving nation&mdash;I do not think, however,
      with equal pressure at all parts of the line. It formed itself into a
      battering ram with a pointed end, and this point was thrust at the heart
      of the English wing.</p>

      <p>It was impossible to resist this onslaught. If the British forces had
      stood against it they would have been crushed and broken. Our gunners
      were magnificent, and shelled the advancing German columns so that the
      dead lay heaped up along the way which was leading down to Paris; but as
      one of them told me: "It made no manner of difference; as soon as we had
      smashed one lot another followed, column after column, and by sheer
      weight of numbers we could do nothing to check them."</p>

      <p>After this the British forces fell back, fighting all the time. The
      line of the Allies was now in the shape of a V, the Germans thrusting
      their main attack deep into the angle.</p>

      <p>This position remained the same until Monday, or, rather, had
      completed itself by that date, the retirement of the troops being
      maintained with masterly skill and without any undue haste.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Gen. Pau was sustaining a terrific attack on the French
      centre by the German left centre, which culminated on (date omitted).
      The River Oise, which runs between beautiful meadows, was choked with
      corpses and red with blood.</p>

      <p>From an eyewitness of this great battle, an officer of an infantry
      regiment, who escaped with a slight wound, I learned that the German
      onslaught had been repelled by a series of brilliant bayonet and cavalry
      charges.</p>

      <p>"The Germans," he said, "had the elite of their army engaged against
      us, including the Tenth Army Corps and the Imperial Guard, but the
      heroism of our troops was sublime. Every man knew that the safety of
      France depended upon him and was ready to sacrifice his life, if need be,
      with joyful enthusiasm. They not only resisted the enemy's attack but
      took the offensive, and, in spite of their overpowering numbers, gave
      them tremendous punishment. They had to recoil before our guns, which
      swept their ranks, and their columns were broken and routed.</p>

      <p>"Hundreds of them were bayoneted, and hundreds were hurled into the
      river. The whole field of battle was outlined by dead and dying men whom
      they had to abandon. Certainly their losses were enormous, and I felt
      that the German retreat was in full swing and that we could claim a real
      victory for the time being."</p>

      <p>Nevertheless the inevitable happened, owing to the vast reserves of
      the enemy, who brought up four divisions, and Gen. Pau was compelled to
      give ground.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday German skirmishers with light artillery were coming
      southward, and the sound of their field guns greeted my ears in that town
      which I shall always remember with unpleasant recollections in spite of
      its Old World beauty and the loveliness of the scene in which it is set.
      It seemed to me that this was the right place to be in order to get into
      touch with the French Army on the way to the capital. As a matter of
      fact, it was the wrong place from all points of view; it was nothing less
      than a deathtrap, and it was by a thousand-to-one chance that I succeeded
      in escaping quite a nasty kind of fate.</p>

      <p>I might have suspected that something was wrong with the place by the
      strange look on the face of a friendly French peasant, whom I met. He had
      described to me in a very vivid way the disposition of the French troops
      on the neighboring hills. Down the road came suddenly parties of peasants
      with fear in their eyes. Some of them were in farm carts and put their
      horses to a stumbling gallop.</p>

      <p>Women with blanched faces, carrying children in their arms, trudged
      along the dusty highway, and it was clear that these people were afraid
      of something behind them. There were not many of them, and when they had
      passed the countryside was strangely and uncannily quiet. There was only
      the sound of singing birds above fields which were flooded with the
      golden light of the setting sun.</p>

      <p>Then I came into the town. An intense silence brooded there among the
      narrow little streets below the old Norman church&mdash;a white jewel on
      the rising ground beyond. Almost every house was shuttered with blind
      eyes; but here and there I looked through an open window into deserted
      rooms.  No human face returned my gaze. It was an abandoned town, emptied
      of all its people, who had fled with fear in their eyes, like those
      peasants along the roadway.</p>

      <p>But presently I saw a human form; it was the figure of a French
      dragoon with his carbine slung behind his back. He was stopping by the
      side of a number of gunpowder bags. A little further away were little
      groups of soldiers at work by two bridges, one over a stream and one over
      a road.  They were working very calmly, and I could see what they were
      doing; they were mining bridges to blow them up at a given signal.</p>

      <p>As I went further I saw that the streets were strewn with broken
      bottles and littered with wire entanglements, very artfully and carefully
      made.</p>

      <p>It was a queer experience. It was obvious that there was very grim
      business being done, and that the soldiers were waiting for something to
      happen. At the railway station I quickly learned the truth; the Germans
      were only a few miles away, in great force. At any moment they might come
      down, smashing everything in their way and killing every human being
      along that road.</p>

      <p>The station master, a brave old type, and one or two porters had
      determined to stay on to the last. "We are here," he said, as though the
      Germans would have to reckon with him; but he was emphatic in his request
      for me to leave at once if another train could be got away, which was
      very uncertain. As a matter of fact, after a bad quarter of an hour I was
      put on the last train to escape from this threatened town, and left it
      with the sound of German guns in my ears, followed by a dull explosion
      when the bridge behind me was blown up.</p>

      <p>My train, in which there were only four other men, skirted the German
      army, and by a twist in the line almost ran into the enemy's country, but
      we rushed through the night, and the engine driver laughed and put his
      oily hand up to salute when I stepped out to the platform of an unknown
      station. "The Germans won't get us, after all," he said. It was a little
      risky, all the same.</p>

      <p>The station was crowded with French soldiers, and they were soon
      telling me their experience of the hard fighting in which they had been
      engaged.  They were dirty, unshaven, dusty from head to foot, scorched by
      the August sun, in tattered uniforms and broken boots; but they were
      beautiful men for all their dirt, and the laughing courage, quiet
      confidence, and unbragging simplicity with which they assured me that the
      Germans would soon be caught in a death trap and sent to their
      destruction filled me with admiration which I cannot express in words.
      All the odds were against them; they had fought the hardest of all
      actions&mdash;the retirement from the fighting line&mdash;but they had
      absolute faith in the ultimate success of their allied arms.</p>

      <p>I managed to get to Paris. It was in the middle of the night, but
      extraordinary scenes were taking place. It had become known during the
      day that Paris was no longer the seat of the Government, which has moved
      to Bordeaux. The Parisians had had notice of four days in which to
      destroy their houses within the zone of fortifications, and, to add to
      the cold fear occasioned by this news, aeroplanes had dropped bombs upon
      the Gare de l'Est that afternoon.</p>

      <p>There was a rush last night to get away from the capital, and the
      railway stations were great camps of fugitives, in which the richest and
      poorest citizens were mingled with their women and children. But the
      tragedy deepened when it was heard that most of the lines to the east had
      been cut, and that the only line remaining open to Dieppe would probably
      be destroyed during the next few hours. A great wail of grief arose from
      the crowds, and the misery of these people was pitiful.</p>

      <p>Among them were groups of soldiers of many regiments. Many of them
      were wounded and lay on stretchers on the floor among crying babies and
      weary-eyed women. They had been beaten and were done for until the end of
      the war. But, alone among the panic-stricken crowd&mdash;panic-stricken,
      yet not noisy or hysterical, but very quiet and restrained for the most
      part&mdash;the soldiers were cheerful, and even gay.</p>

      <p>Among them were some British troops, and I had a talk with them. They
      had been fighting for ten days without cessation, and their story is
      typical of the way in which all our troops held themselves.</p>

      <p>"We had been fighting night and day," said a Sergeant. "For the whole
      of that time the only rest from fighting was when we were marching and
      retiring." He spoke of the German Army as an avalanche of armed men.
      "You can't mow that down," he said. "We kill them and kill them, and
      still they come on. They seem to have an inexhaustible supply of fresh
      troops. Directly we check them in one attack a fresh attack is developed.
      It is impossible to oppose such a mass of men with any success."</p>

      <p>This splendid fellow, who was severely wounded, was still so much
      master of himself, so supreme in his common sense, that he was able to
      get the right perspective about the general situation.</p>

      <p>"It is not right to say we have met with disaster," he said. "We have
      to expect that nowadays. Besides, what if a battalion was cut up? That
      did not mean defeat. While one regiment suffered, another got off
      lightly"; and by the words of that Sergeant the public may learn to see
      the truth of what has happened. I can add my own evidence to his. All
      along the lines I have spoken to officers and men, and the actual truth
      is that the British Army is still unbroken, having retired in perfect
      order to good positions&mdash;the most marvelous feat ever accomplished
      in modern warfare.</p>

      <p>From Paris I went by the last train again which has got through to
      Dieppe. Lately I seem to have become an expert in catching the last
      train. It was only a branch line which struggles in an erratic way
      through the west of France, and the going was long and painful, because
      at every wayside station the carriages were besieged by people trying to
      escape. They were very patient and very brave. Even when they found that
      it was impossible to get one more human being on or one more package into
      the already crowded train they turned away in quiet grief, and when women
      wept over their babies it was silently and without abandonment to
      despair. The women of France are brave, God knows. I have seen their
      courage during the past ten days&mdash;gallantry surpassing that of the
      men, because of their own children in their arms without shelter, food,
      or safety in this terrible flight from the advancing enemy.</p>

      <p>Enormous herds of cattle were being driven into Paris. For miles the
      roads were thronged with them; and down other roads away from Paris
      families were trekking to far fields with their household goods piled
      into bullock carts, pony carts, and wheelbarrows.</p>

      <p>Two batteries of artillery were stationed by the line, and a regiment
      of infantry was hiding in the hollows of the grassy slopes. Their
      outposts were scanning the horizon, and it was obvious that the Germans
      were expected at this point in order to cut the last way of escape from
      the capital.</p>

      <p>One of the enemy's aeroplanes flew above our heads, circled around,
      and then disappeared. It dropped no bombs and was satisfied with its
      reconnoissance. The whistle of the train shrieked out, and there was a
      cheer from the French gunners as we went on our way to safety, leaving
      them behind at the post of peril.</p>

      <p>ST. PIERRE DU VAUVRAY, Sept. 6.&mdash;England received a hint
      yesterday as to a change in the German campaign, but only those who have
      been, as I have, into the very heart of this monstrous horror of war,
      seeing the flight of hundreds of thousands of people before an
      overwhelming enemy and following the lines of the allied armies in their
      steady retirement before an apparently irresistible advance, may realize
      even dimly the meaning of the amazing transformation that has happened
      during the last few days.</p>

      <p>For when I wrote my last dispatch from Arques-la-Bataille, after my
      adventures along the French and English lines, it seemed as inevitable as
      the rising of next day's sun that the Germans should enter Paris on the
      very day when I wrote my dispatch. Still not a single shot has come
      crashing upon the French fortifications.</p>

      <p>At least a million men&mdash;that is no exaggeration of a light pen,
      but the sober and actual truth&mdash;were advancing steadily upon the
      capital last Tuesday. They were close to Beauvais when I escaped from
      what was then a death-trap. They were fighting our British troops at
      Creil when I came to that town. Upon the following days they were holding
      our men in the Forest of Compi&egrave;gne. They had been as near to Paris
      as Senlis, almost within gunshot of the outer forts.</p>

      <p>"Nothing seems to stop them," said many soldiers with whom I spoke.
      "We kill them and kill them, but they come on."</p>

      <p>The situation seemed to me almost ready for the supreme
      tragedy&mdash;the capture or destruction of Paris. The northwest of
      France lay very open to the enemy, abandoned as far south as
      Abb&eacute;ville and Amiens, too lightly held by a mixed army corps of
      French and Algerian troops with their headquarters at Aumale.</p>

      <p>Here was an easy way to Paris.</p>

      <p>Always obsessed with the idea that the Germans must come from the
      east, the almost fatal error of this war, the French had girdled Paris
      with almost impenetrable forts on the east side, from those of Ecouen and
      Montmorency, by the far-flung forts of Chelles and Champigny, to those of
      Susy and Villeneuve, on the outer lines of the triple cordon; but on the
      west side, between Pontoise and Versailles, the defenses of Paris were
      weak. I say "were," because during the last three days thousands of men
      have been digging trenches and throwing up ramparts. Only the snakelike
      Seine, twining into Pegoud loop, forms a natural defense to the western
      approach to the city, none too secure against men who have crossed many
      rivers in their desperate assaults.</p>

      <p>This, then, was the Germans' chance; it was for this that they had
      fought their way westward and southward through incessant battlefields
      from Mons and Charleroi to St. Quentin and Amiens and down to Creil and
      Compi&egrave;gne, flinging away human life as though it were but rubbish
      for deathpits. The prize of Paris, Paris the great and beautiful, seemed
      to be within their grasp.</p>

      <p>It was their intention to smash their way into it by this western
      entry and then to skin it alive. Holding this city at ransom, it was
      their idea to force France to her knees under threat of making a vast and
      desolate ruin of all those palaces and churches and noble buildings in
      which the soul of French history is enshrined.</p>

      <p>They might have done it but for one thing which has upset all the
      cold-blooded calculations of their staff, that thing which perhaps I may
      be pardoned for calling the miracle. They might have done it, I think,
      last Wednesday and Thursday, even perhaps as late as last Friday.</p>

      <p>I am not saying these things from rumor and hearsay, I am writing from
      the evidence of my own eyes after traveling several hundreds of miles in
      France during the last four days along the main strategical lines, grim
      sentinels guarding the last barriers to that approaching death which is
      sweeping on its way through France to the rich harvest of Paris, which it
      was eager to destroy.</p>

      <p>There was only one thing to do to escape from the menace of this
      death.  By all the ways open, by any way, the population of Paris emptied
      itself like rushing rivers of humanity along all the lines which promised
      anything like safety.</p>

      <p>Only those stayed behind to whom life means very little away from
      Paris and who if death came desired to die in the city of their life.</p>

      <p>Again I write from what I saw and to tell the honest truth from what I
      suffered, for the fatigue of this hunting for facts behind the screen of
      war is exhausting to all but one's moral strength, and even to that.</p>

      <p>I found myself in the midst of a new and extraordinary activity of the
      French and English Armies. Regiments were being rushed up to the centre
      of the allied forces toward Creil, Montdidier, and Noyon. That was before
      last Tuesday, when the English
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'toops']">troops</ins>
      were fighting hard at Creil.</p>

      <p>This great movement continued for several days, putting to a severe
      test the French railway system, which is so wonderfully organized that it
      achieved this mighty transportation of troops with clockwork regularity.
      Working to a time table dictated by some great brain which in
      Headquarters Staff of the French Army, calculated with perfect precision
      the conditions of a network of lines on which troop trains might be run
      to a given point. It was an immense victory of organization, and a
      movement which heartened one observer at least to believe that the German
      deathblow would again be averted.</p>

      <p>I saw regiment after regiment entraining. Men from the Southern
      Provinces, speaking the patois of the South; men from the Eastern
      Departments whom I had seen a month before, at the beginning of the war,
      at Chalons and Epernay and Nancy, and men from the southwest and centre
      of France, in garrisons along the Loire. They were all in splendid
      spirits and utterly undaunted by the rapidity of the German advance.</p>

      <p>"It is nothing, my little one," said a dirty, unshaved gentleman with
      the laughing eyes of a D'Artagnan; "we shall bite their heads off. These
      brutal bosches are going to put themselves in a guetapens, a veritable
      deathtrap. We shall have them at last."</p>

      <p>Many of them had fought at Longwy and along the heights of the Vosges.
      The youngest of them had bristling beards, their blue coats with
      turned-back flaps were war worn and flanked with the dust of long
      marches; their red trousers were sloppy and stained, but they had not
      forgotten how to laugh, and the gallantry of their spirits was a joy to
      see.</p>

      <p>They are very proud, these French soldiers, of fighting side by side
      with their old foes. The English now, after long centuries of strife,
      from Edward, the Black Prince, to Wellington, are their brothers-in-arms
      upon the battlefields, and because I am English they offered me their
      cigarettes and made me one of them. But I realized even then that the
      individual is of no account in this inhuman business of war.</p>

      <p>It is only masses of men that matter, moved by common obedience at the
      dictation of mysterious far-off powers, and I thanked Heaven that masses
      of men were on the move rapidly in vast numbers and in the right
      direction to support the French lines which had fallen back from Amiens a
      few hours before I left that town, and whom I had followed in their
      retirement, back and back, with the English always strengthening their
      left, but retiring with them almost to the outskirts of Paris itself.</p>

      <p>Only this could save Paris&mdash;the rapid strengthening of the allied
      front by enormous reserves strong enough to hold back the arrow-shaped
      battering ram of the enemy's main army.</p>

      <p>Undoubtedly the French Headquarters Staff was working heroically and
      with fine intelligence to save the situation at the very gates of Paris.
      The country was being swept absolutely clean of troops in all parts of
      France, where they had been waiting as reserves.</p>

      <p>It was astounding to me to see, after those three days of rushing
      troop trains and of crowded stations not large enough to contain the
      regiments, how on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday last an air of profound
      solitude and peace had taken possession of all these routes.</p>

      <p>In my long journey through and about France and circling round Paris I
      found myself wondering sometimes whether all this war had not been a
      dreadful illusion without reality, and a transformation had taken place,
      startling in its change, from military turmoil to rural peace.</p>

      <p>Dijon was emptied of its troops. The road to Chalons was deserted by
      all but fugitives. The great armed camp at Chalons itself had been
      cleared out except for a small garrison. The troops at Tours had gone
      northward to the French centre. All our English reserves had been rushed
      up to the front from Havre and Rouen.</p>

      <p>There was only one deduction to be drawn from this great, swift
      movement&mdash;the French and English lines had been supported by every
      available battalion to save Paris from its menace of destruction, to meet
      the weight of the enemy's metal by a force strong enough to resist its
      mighty mass.</p>

      <p>It was still possible that the Germans might be smashed on their left
      wing, hurled back to the west between Paris and the sea, and cut off from
      their line of communications. It was undoubtedly this impending peril
      which scared the enemy's Headquarters Staff and upset all its
      calculations. They had not anticipated the rapidity of the supporting
      movement of the allied armies, and at the very gates of Paris they saw
      themselves balked of their prize, the greatest prize of the war, by the
      necessity of changing front.</p>

      <p>To do them justice, they realized instantly the new order of things,
      and with quick and marvelous decision did not hesitate to alter the
      direction of their main force. Instead of proceeding to the west of Paris
      they swung round steadily to the southeast in order to keep their armies
      away from the enveloping movement of the French and English and drive
      their famous wedge-like formation southward for the purpose of dividing
      the allied forces of the west from the French Army of the East.  The
      miraculous had happened, and Paris, for a little time at least, is
      unmolested.</p>

      <p>That brings me back to the fighting at Creil and Compi&egrave;gne,
      which preceded from last Tuesday until two days later.</p>

      <p>The guns were at work at midnight on Tuesday when I passed the English
      Headquarters. This battle had only one purpose so far as the Germans were
      concerned. It was to keep our British soldiers busy, as well as to hold
      the front of the French allies on our right, while their d&eacute;bordant
      movements took place behind this fighting screen.</p>

      <p>Once again, as throughout the war, they showed their immense
      superiority in mitrailleuses, which gives them marvelous mobility and a
      very deadly advantage. They masked these quick-firers with great skill
      until they had drawn on the English and French infantry and then spilled
      lead into their ranks. Once again, also the French were too impetuous, as
      they have always been, and as they still are, in spite of Gen. Joffre's
      severe rebuke.</p>

      <p>Careless of quick-firers, which experience should have taught them
      were masked behind the enemy's advance posts, they charged with the
      bayonet, and suffered needlessly heavy losses. One can only admire the
      gallantry of men who dare to charge on foot against the enemy's mounted
      men and who actually put a squadron of them to flight, but one must say
      again: "C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre."</p>

      <p>There have been many incidents of heroism in these last days of
      fighting. It is, for instance, immensely characteristic of the French
      spirit that an infantry battalion, having put to flight a detachment of
      German outposts in the forest of Compi&egrave;gne, calmly sat down to
      have a picnic in the woods until, as they sat over their hot soup,
      laughing at their exploit, they were attacked by a new force and cut to
      pieces.</p>

      <p>But let me describe the new significance of the main German advance.
      Their right army has struck down to the southeast of Paris, through
      Ch&acirc;teau Thiery to La Fert&eacute;-sur-Jouarre and beyond. Their
      centre army is coming hard down from Troyes, in the Department of the
      Aube, and the army of the left has forced the French to evacuate Rheims
      and fall back in a southwesterly direction.</p>

      <p>It would not be right of me to indicate the present position of the
      British troops or describe the great scenes at their base, which is now
      removed to a position which enables our forces to hold the eastern
      approach to Paris. It is a wonderful sight to pass the commissariat camp,
      where, among other munitions of war, is a park of British aeroplanes,
      which are of vital importance to our work of reconnoissance.</p>

      <p>Looking, therefore, at the extraordinary transformation throughout the
      field of war in France, one thing stands out clear-cut and distinct.
      Having been thwarted in their purpose to walk through the western way to
      Paris by the enormous forces massed on their flanks, the Germans have
      adopted an entirely new plan of campaign and have thrust their armies
      deep down into the centre of France in order to divide the western armies
      of the Allies from the army on the eastern frontier. It is a menacing
      manoeuvre, and it cannot be hidden that the army of Lorraine is in danger
      of being cut off by the enemy's armies of the left.</p>

      <p>At the same time the German right is swinging round in a southwesterly
      direction in order to attack the allied forces on the east and south.
      Paris is thus left out of account for the time being, but it depends upon
      the issues of the next few days whether the threatened peril will be
      averted from it by the immense army now protecting it. I believe the
      spirit of our own troops and their French comrades is so splendid that
      with their new strength they will be equal to that formidable attack.</p>

      <p>Nothing certainly is being left to chance. For miles all around Paris
      trenches are being dug in the roads, and little sectional trenches on the
      broad roads of France, first one on this side of the way, and then one on
      the other side, so that a motor car traveling along the road has to drive
      in a series of sharp curves to avoid pitfalls.</p>

      <p>There was feverish activity on the west side of the Paris
      fortifications when I passed between St. Germain and St. Denis.</p>

      <p>Earthworks are being constantly thrown up between the forts, and the
      triple curves of the Seine are being intrenched so that thousands of men
      may take cover there and form a terrific defense against any attack.</p>

      <p>Gen. Galli&eacute;ni, the Military Governor of Paris, is a man of
      energy and iron resolution, and no doubt under his command Paris, if it
      has to undergo a siege, (which God avert!) will defend itself well, now
      that it has had these precious days of respite.</p>

      <p>After wandering along the westerly and southerly roads I started for
      Paris when thousands and scores of thousands were flying from it. At that
      time I believed, as all France believed, that in a few hours German
      shells would be crashing across the fortifications of the city and that
      Paris the beautiful would be Paris the infernal. It needed a good deal of
      resolution on my part to go deliberately to a city from which the
      population was fleeing, and I confess quite honestly that I had a nasty
      sensation in the neighborhood of my waistcoat buttons at the thought.</p>

      <p>Along the road from Tours to Paris there were sixty unbroken miles of
      people&mdash;on my honor, I do not exaggerate, but write the absolute
      truth.  They were all people who had despaired of breaking through the
      dense masses of their fellow-citizens camped around the railway stations,
      and had decided to take to the roads as the only way of escape.</p>

      <p>The vehicles were taxicabs, for which the rich paid fabulous prices;
      motor cars which had escaped military requisition, farmers' carts laden
      with several families and piles of household goods, shop carts drawn by
      horses already tired to the point of death because of the weight of the
      people who crowded behind pony traps and governess carts.</p>

      <p>Many persons, well dressed and belonging obviously to well-to-do
      bourgeoisie, were wheeling barrows like costers, but instead of trundling
      cabbages were pushing forward sleeping babies and little children, who
      seemed on the first stage to find new amusement and excitement in the
      journey from home; but for the most part they trudged along bravely,
      carrying their babies and holding the hands of their little ones.</p>

      <p>They were of all classes, rank and fortune being annihilated by the
      common tragedy. Elegant women whose beauty is known in Paris salons,
      whose frivolity, perhaps, in the past was the main purpose of their life,
      were now on a level with the peasant mothers of the French suburbs and
      with the midinettes of Montmartre, and their courage did not fail them so
      quickly.</p>

      <p>I looked into many proud, brave faces of these delicate women, walking
      in high-heeled shoes, all too frail for the hard-dusty roadways. They
      belonged to the same race and breed as those ladies who defied death with
      fine disdain upon the scaffold of the guillotine in the great
      Revolution.</p>

      <p>They were leaving Paris now, not because of any fears for
      themselves&mdash;I believe they were fearless&mdash;but because they had
      decided to save the little sons and daughters of soldier fathers.</p>

      <p>This great army in retreat was made up of every type familiar in
      Paris.</p>

      <p>Here were women of the gay world, poor creatures whose painted faces
      had been washed with tears, and whose tight skirts and white stockings
      were never made for a long march down the highways of France.</p>

      <p>Here also were thousands of those poor old ladies who live on a few
      francs a week in the top attics of the Paris streets, which Balzac knew;
      they had fled from their poor sanctuaries and some of them were still
      carrying cats and canaries, as dear to them as their own lives.</p>

      <p>There was one young woman who walked with a pet monkey on her shoulder
      while she carried a bird in a golden cage. Old men, who remembered 1870,
      gave their arms to old ladies to whom they had made love when the
      Prussians were at the gates of Paris then.</p>

      <p>It was pitiful to see these old people now hobbling along together.
      Pitiful, but beautiful also, because of their lasting love.</p>

      <p>Young boy students, with ties as black as their hats and rat-tail
      hair, marched in small companies of comrades, singing brave songs, as
      though they had no fear in their hearts, and very little food, I think,
      in their stomachs.</p>

      <p>Shopgirls and concierges, city clerks, old aristocrats, young boys and
      girls, who supported grandfathers and grandmothers and carried new-born
      babies and gave pick-a-back rides to little brothers and sisters, came
      along the way of retreat.</p>

      <p>Each human being in the vast torrent of life will have an
      unforgettable story of adventure to tell if life remains. As a novelist I
      should have been glad to get their narratives along this road for a great
      story of suffering and strange adventure, but there was no time for that
      and no excuse.</p>

      <p>When I met many of them they were almost beyond the power of words.
      The hot sun of this September had beaten down upon them&mdash;scorching
      them as in the glow of molten metal. Their tongues clave to their mouths
      with thirst.</p>

      <p>Some of them had that wild look in their eyes which is the first sign
      of the delirium of thirst and fatigue.</p>

      <p>Nothing to eat or drink could be found on the way from Paris. The
      little roadside caf&eacute;s had been cleared out by the preceding
      hordes.</p>

      <p>Unless these people carried their own food and drink they could have
      none except of the charity of their comrades in misfortune, and that
      charity has exceeded all other acts of heroism in this war. Women gave
      their last biscuit, their last little drop of wine, to poor mothers whose
      children were famishing with thirst and hunger; peasant women fed other
      women's babies when their own were satisfied.</p>

      <p>It was a tragic road. At every mile of it there were people who had
      fainted on the roadside and poor old men and women who could go no
      further, but sat on the banks below the hedges, weeping silently or
      bidding younger ones go forward and leave them to their fate. Young women
      who had stepped out so jauntily at first were footsore and lame, so they
      limped along with lines of pain about their lips and eyes.</p>

      <p>Many of the taxicabs, bought at great prices, and many of the motor
      cars had broken down as I passed, and had been abandoned by their owners,
      who had decided to walk. Farmers' carts had bolted into ditches and lost
      their wheels. Wheelbarrows, too heavy to be trundled, had been tilted up,
      with all their household goods spilt into the roadway, and the children
      had been carried further, until at last darkness came, and their only
      shelter was a haystack in a field under the harvest moon.</p>

      <p>For days also I have been wedged up with fugitives in railway trains
      more dreadful than the open roads, stifling in their heat and
      heart-racking in their cargoes of misery. Poor women have wept
      hysterically clasping my hand, a stranger's hand, for comfort in their
      wretchedness and weakness. Yet on the whole they have shown amazing
      courage, and, after their tears, have laughed at their own breakdown,
      and, always children of France, have been superb, so that again and again
      I have wondered at the gallantry with which they endured this horror.
      Young boys have revealed the heroic strain in them and have played the
      part of men in helping their mothers. And yet, when I came at last into
      Paris against all this tide of retreat, it seemed a needless fear that
      had driven these people away.</p>

      <p>Then I passed long lines of beautiful little villas on the Seine side,
      utterly abandoned among their trees and flowers. A solitary fisherman
      held his line above the water as though all the world were at peace, and
      in a field close to the fortifications which I expected to see bursting
      with shells, an old peasant bent above the furrows and planted cabbages.
      Then, at last, I walked through the streets of Paris and found them
      strangely quiet and tranquil.</p>

      <p>The people I met looked perfectly calm. There were a few children
      playing in the gardens of Champs Elys&eacute;es and under the Arc de
      Triomph symbolical of the glory of France.</p>

      <p>I looked back upon the beauty of Paris all golden in the light of the
      setting sun, with its glinting spires and white gleaming palaces and rays
      of light flashing in front of the golden trophies of its monuments.
      Paris was still unbroken. No shell had come shattering into this city of
      splendor, and I thanked Heaven that for a little while the peril had
      passed.</p>


      <h3>A Zouave's Story</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Philip Gibbs of The London Daily Chronicle.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[Special Dispatch to <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span>.]</p>

      <p>CREIL, Sept. 10.&mdash;I could write this narrative as a historian,
      with details gathered from many different witnesses at various parts of
      the lines, in a cold and aloof way, but I prefer to tell it in the words
      of a young officer of the Zouaves who was in the thickest of fighting
      until when I met him and gave him wine and biscuits. He was put out of
      action by a piece of shell which smashed his left arm. He told me the
      story of the battle as he sat back, hiding his pain by a little careless
      smile of contempt, and splashed with blood which made a mess of his
      uniform.</p>

      <p>"For four days previous to Monday, Sept. 7," he said, "we were engaged
      in clearing out the German bosches from all the villages on the left bank
      of the Ourcq, which they had occupied in order to protect the flank of
      their right wing. Unfortunately for us the English heavy artillery, which
      would have smashed the beggars to bits, had not yet come up to help us,
      although we expected them with some anxiety, as big business events began
      as soon as we drove the outposts back to their main lines.</p>

      <p>"However, we were equal to the preliminary task, and, heartened by the
      news of an ammunition convoy which had been turned into a pretty
      fireworks display by 'Soixante-dix' Pau, my Zouaves, (as you see, I
      belong to the First Division, which has a reputation to keep up, n'est ce
      pas?) were in splendid form. Of course, they all laughed at me. They
      wanted to get near those German guns and nearer still to the gunners.
      That was before they knew the exact meaning of shellfire well.</p>

      <p>"They did good things, those Zouaves of mine, but it wasn't pleasant
      work.  We fought from village to village, very close fighting, so that
      sometimes we could look into our enemy's eyes. The Moroccans were with
      us.  The native troops are unlike my boys, who are Frenchmen, and they
      were like demons with their bayonet work.</p>

      <p>"Several of the villages were set on fire by the Germans before they
      retired from them, and soon great columns of smoke with pillars of flames
      and clouds of flying sparks rose up into the blue sky and made a picture
      of hell there, for really it was hell on earth. Our gunners were shelling
      Germans from pillar to post, as it were, and strewing the ground with
      their dead. It was across and among these dead bodies that we infantry
      had to charge.</p>

      <p>"They lay about in heaps. It made me sick, even in the excitement of
      it all.  The enemy's quick-firers were marvelous. I am bound to say we
      did not get it all our own way. They always manoeuvre them in the same
      style, and a very clever style it is. First of all, they mask them with
      infantry; then, when the French charge, they reveal them and put us to
      the test under the most withering fire. It is almost impossible to stand
      against it, and in this case we had to retire after each rush for about
      250 meters. Then, quick as lightning, the Germans got their mitrailleuses
      across the ground which we had yielded to them and waited for us to come
      on again, when they repeated the same operation.</p>

      <p>"I can tell you it was pretty trying to the nerves. My Zouaves were
      very steady in spite of fairly heavy losses. It is quite untrue to say
      that the Germans have a greater number of mitrailleuses than the French.
      I believe that the proportion is exactly the same to each division, but
      they handle them more cleverly, and their fire is much more effective
      than ours.</p>

      <p>"In a village named Penchard there was some very sharp fighting, and
      some of our artillery was posted thereabout. Presently a German aeroplane
      came overhead, circling round in reconnoissance; but it was out for more
      than that. Suddenly it began to drop bombs and, whether by design or
      otherwise, they exploded in the middle of a field hospital.  One of my
      friends, a young doctor, was wounded in the left arm by a bullet from one
      of these bombs, but I don't know what other casualties there were. The
      inevitable happened shortly after the disappearance of the aeroplane.
      German shells searched the position and found it with unpleasant
      accuracy. It is always the same. The German aeroplanes are really
      wonderful in the way they search out the positions of our guns.  We
      always know that within half an hour of observation by aeroplane shells
      will begin to fall above gunners, unless they have altered their
      position. It was so in this fighting round Meaux yesterday.</p>

      <p>"For four days this hunting among the villages on the left bank of the
      Ourcq went on all the time, and we were not very happy with ourselves.
      The truth was we had no water and were four days thirsty. It was really
      terrible, for the heat was terrific during the day, and some of us were
      almost mad with thirst. Our tongues were blistered and swollen, our eyes
      had a silly kind of look in them, and at night we had horrid dreams. It
      was, I assure you, intolerable agony.</p>

      <p>"I have said we were four days without drink, and that was because we
      used our last water for our horses. A gentleman has to do that, you will
      agree, and a French soldier is not a barbarian. Even then the horses had
      to go without a drop of water for two days, and I'm not ashamed to say I
      wept salt tears to see the sufferings of those poor, innocent creatures
      who did not understand the meaning of all this bloody business and who
      wondered at our cruelty.</p>

      <p>"The nights were dreadful. All around us were burning villages, and at
      every faint puff of wind sparks floated about them like falling
      stars.</p>

      <p>"But other fires were burning. Under the cover of darkness the Germans
      had piled the dead into great heaps and had covered them with straw and
      paraffin; then they had set a torch to these funeral pyres.</p>

      <p>"Carrion crows were about in the dawn that followed. One of my own
      comrades lay very badly wounded, and when he wakened out of his
      unconsciousness one of these beastly birds was sitting on his chest
      waiting for him to die. That is war.</p>

      <p>"The German shells were terrifying. I confess to you that there were
      times when my nerves were absolutely gone. I crouched down with my men
      (we were in open formation) and ducked my head at the sound of the
      bursting shell, and I trembled in every limb as though I had a fit of
      ague.</p>

      <p>"It is true that in reality the German shells are not very effective.
      Only about one in four explodes nicely, but it is a bad thing when, as
      happened to me, the shells plopped around in a diameter of fifty meters.
      One hears the zip-zip of bullets, the boom of the great guns, the
      ste-tang of our French artillery, and in all this infernal experience of
      noise and stench, the screams at times of dying horses and men joined
      with the fury of gunfire and rising shrill above it, no man may boast of
      his courage. There were moments when I was a coward with all of them.</p>

      <p>"But one gets used to it, as to all things. My ague did not last long.
      Soon I was shouting and cheering. Again we cleared the enemy out of the
      village of Bregy, and that was where I fell, wounded in the arm pretty
      badly by a bit of shell. When I came to myself a brother officer told me
      things were going on well and that we had rolled back the German right.
      That was better than bandages to me. I felt very well again, in spite of
      my weakness.</p>

      <p>"It is the beginning of the end, and the Germans are on the run. They
      are exhausted and demoralized. Their pride has been broken; they are
      short of ammunition; they know their plans have failed.</p>

      <p>"Now that we have them on the move nothing will save them. This war is
      going to be finished quicker than people thought. I believe that in a few
      days the enemy will be broken and that we shall have nothing more to do
      than kill them as they fight back in retreat."</p>

      <p>That is the story, without any retouching of my pen, of a young
      Lieutenant of Zouaves whom I met after the battle of Meaux, with blood
      still splashed upon his uniform.</p>

      <p>It is a human story, giving the experience of only one individual in
      the great battle, but it gives also in outline a narrative of that great
      military operation which has done irreparable damage to the German right
      wing in its plan of campaign and thrust it back across the Ourcq in a
      great retiring movement which has also begun upon the German centre and
      left.</p>


      <h3>When War Burst on Arras</h3>

      <p class="h3">[A Special Dispatch to <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span> and The London
      Daily Chronicle.]</p>

      <p>A TOWN IN FRANCE, Oct. 7.&mdash;Arras has been the pivot of a fierce
      battle which, commencing Thursday, was still in progress when I was
      forced to leave the citadel three days later.</p>

      <p>In that period I was fortunate enough to penetrate into the firing
      line, and the experience is one that will never be dimmed in my memory.
      Like the movements of so many pawns on a mammoth chessboard was the
      feinting with scattered outposts to test the strength of the enemy.</p>

      <p>I saw the action open with skirmishes at Vitry-en-Artois, and next
      morning one of the hardest battles which make a link in the chain flung
      right across France of the gigantic battle of rivers was being prosecuted
      before my eyes.</p>

      <p>The days that ensued were full of feverish and hectic motion. Arras
      rattled and throbbed with the flow of an army and all the tragedy which
      war brings in its train. There were moments when its cobbled streets were
      threaded by streams of wounded from the country beyond. Guns boomed
      incessantly, a fitting requiem to the sad little processions which
      occasionally revealed that some poor fellow had sacrificed his life for
      the flag which accompanied him to his grave.</p>

      <p>I reached Arras on Sept. 29. The Germans had occupied it a fortnight
      earlier. Now it was placid, sleepy, and deserted, and bore no outward
      signs of having suffered from their occupation. I learned, however, that
      although they had refrained from demolishing buildings, there had been
      scenes of debauchery, and private houses had been ransacked.</p>

      <p>It was declared that the only German paying for anything during the
      whole of the fortnight's occupation was a member of the Hohenzollern
      family, an important officer who had made the H&ocirc;tel d'Univers his
      headquarters.</p>

      <p>I decided to pass on to Vitry-en-Artois, twelve miles distant and six
      kilometers from Douai, where I had heard the Allies were in force. Here I
      obtained a room in a hotel.</p>

      <p>Within a short while I saw armed cars. There came many warriors in
      many cars, cars fitted with mitrailleuses, cars advancing backward, cars
      with two soldiers in the back of each with their rifles rested on the
      back cushions and their fingers on the triggers, and with the muzzles of
      mitrailleuses pointing over their heads. Several cavalry scouts, too, are
      in the streets.</p>

      <p>Once I ventured my head a little outside of the door and was curtly
      warned to eliminate myself or possibly I would get shot. I eliminated
      myself for the moment.</p>

      <p>Now with dramatic suddenness death touches Vitry with her chill
      fingers.  In the distance, right away beyond the bridge behind a bend in
      the road, there is a clatter of hoofs. It stops. Again it goes on and
      stops for about a couple of minutes, and then quite distinctly can be
      heard the sound of a body of horsemen proceeding at a walk.</p>

      <p>The cavalry scouts have vanished into big barns on either side of the
      road, and around the corner of the bridge comes a small body of German
      cavalry. They have passed the spot where the French scouts are hidden and
      I have retreated to my bedroom window, from where I can count twelve of
      the Death's Head riders.</p>

      <p>They are riding to their fate. Right slap up in front of the cars they
      come. A rifle shot rings out from where the French scouts are hidden,
      then another, and that is the signal for the inferno to be loosed.</p>

      <p>C-r-r-r-r-r-ack, and the mitrailleuse spits out a regular hail of
      death, vicious, whiplike, never-ceasing cracks. Two horses are down and
      three men lie prone in the road.</p>

      <p>The Germans have not fired a shot, all their energies being
      concentrated in wildly turning their horses to get back again round the
      bend.</p>

      <p>It is too late. Another two are toppled over by the scouts in the
      barns, and then cars are after them, still spitting out an unending hail
      of lead.</p>

      <p>It seems impossible that even a fly could live in such a stream of
      bullets, yet out of the dozen three get round the bend, and, galloping
      madly, make for the only spot where they can leave the road and get
      across country. Even the automobile and auto-mitrailleuse men cannot
      follow them there.</p>

      <p>These fellows seem perfectly satisfied with a bag of nine, obtained
      without a scratch. All are dead, one of them with over twenty wounds in
      him. Two horses are stone dead, and three others have to be put out of
      their misery. The other four are contentedly standing at the roadside
      munching grass, one with a hind leg lifted a few inches off the
      ground.</p>

      <p>The bodies of the dead Germans are laid side by side in a field to
      await burial. The uniforms are stripped of everything that can be
      removed, buttons and shoulder straps. The men in the cars take the water
      bottles, swords, and revolvers as mementos.</p>

      <p>I imperfectly understood the real meaning of this scrap. I had thought
      it was an encounter between stray forces. A talk with the driver of an
      armed car, however, enlarged my perspective. It was a meeting of the
      outposts of two great opposing armies, one of which was at Douai, the
      other at Cambrai. The feelers of both forces were being extended to
      discover the various positions, preparatory to a big battle, which was
      expected on the morrow (Oct. 1) along the line of
      Cambrai-Douai-Valenciennes.</p>

      <p>It was understood that the Germans had massed in force at Cambrai and
      strong wings were thrown out on both sides, the outposts of one wing, as
      we have already seen, coming into touch with the French at Vitry.</p>

      <p>From the reports of the auto-mitrailleuse men, who cover great
      distances in a day, similar skirmishing had been taking place at Etain,
      (where some farmhouses were burned,) Eterpigny, Croisilles, Boisleux, and
      Boyelles, these places ranging from ten to twenty kilometers from
      Arras.</p>

      <p>There was a general exodus from Vitry and I secured standing room in a
      wagon of the last train leaving for Arras. It was loaded with
      fugitives.</p>

      <p>Arras had changed completely on my return. Its calmness was gone. The
      station was empty of civilians, there were no trains running and the
      station entrance was in charge of a strong picket of soldiers, while the
      road outside echoed to the tread of infantry.</p>

      <p>I stood still in amazement, while my papers were being closely
      examined, and watched regiment after regiment of foot with their
      transport trains complete marching out on the road to Douai. This was
      part of the preparation for the big battle which I was told was going to
      begin tomorrow.</p>

      <p>In the town itself the transformation was still more
      amazing&mdash;soldiers in every street, cavalry, infantry, dragoons,
      lancers, and engineers in ones and twos, and parties of twenty or thirty
      picturesque Moroccans. I never saw such a medley of colors and
      expressions, and the whole town was full of them&mdash;material for one
      army corps at least.</p>

      <p>I installed myself in quarters at the H&ocirc;tel de l'Univers, with
      the intention of getting away the first thing in the morning if possible.
      But it was not possible. I was informed that Arras was now under military
      control, and no permits were being issued whatsoever. The Lieutenant who
      told me this smiled as I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

      <p>"You will bear witness, Monsieur, that I tried my best to get out,"
      said I.</p>

      <p>"Certainly; but why go away?" he asked with a smile. "Arras est tres
      belle ville, Monsieur. You have a good hotel, a good bed, and good food.
      Why should you go out?"</p>

      <p>And so I stayed at Arras.</p>

      <p>That was Sept. 30. The next day I could hear guns. They started at
      about 8 o'clock in the morning, the French guns being in position about
      five kilometers outside of Arras to the south, southeast, and east,
      sixteen batteries of France's artillery or 75-millimeter calibre.</p>

      <p>All day long the guns thundered and roared, and all day long I sat
      outside the caf&eacute; of the H&ocirc;tel des Voyageurs in the Place de
      la Gare. The station building was right in front of me. I longed for a
      position which would enable me to see over the tall buildings on to the
      battlefield beyond. Even the roof of the station would have suited. There
      was a little crowd of officials already there with their field glasses,
      and they could discern what was going on, for I noticed several pointing
      here and there whenever a particularly loud explosion was heard.</p>

      <p>Two men in civilian clothes sat down beside me and gave me "good day,"
      evidently curious as to my nationality. I invited them to join me in
      coffee and cognac, and during the ensuing conversation we all became very
      friendly, and I was given to understand that one of them was the
      volunteer driver of an auto-mitrailleuse who had just come off duty.</p>

      <p>I remarked that it would be very interesting to get a sight of what
      was going on behind the station.</p>

      <p>"Is it very near&mdash;the battle?"</p>

      <p>"About five kilometers, Monsieur. The German guns are ten kilometers
      distant. One of the German shells exploded behind the station this
      morning. Would Monsieur like to walk out a little way?"</p>

      <p>"But surely the pickets will not let me pass beyond the barrier," said
      I.</p>

      <p>My good friend of the auto-mitrailleuse smiled, rose, and buttoned up
      his coat. "Come with me," he invited.</p>

      <p>At the barrier we were stopped, but luck had not deserted me, for in
      the Sergeant in charge of the pickets I recognized another caf&eacute;
      acquaintance of the previous night. We shook hands, exchanged cigarettes,
      and proceeded up and down numerous streets, bearing always southward in
      the direction of the firing, until the open country was reached.</p>

      <p>My companion suddenly caught hold of my arm and we both jumped up the
      bank at the side of the road to let a long string of artillery drivers
      trot past on their way back for more ammunition. Another cloud of dust,
      and coming up behind us was a fresh lot of shells on the way out to the
      firing line.</p>

      <p>Right up in the sky ahead suddenly appeared a ball of yellow greeny
      smoke, which grew bigger and bigger, and then "boom" came the sound of a
      gun about three seconds afterward. A shell had burst in the air about 300
      yards away. Another and another came&mdash;all about the same place. They
      appeared to come from the direction of Bapaume.</p>

      <p>"Bad, very bad," commented my companion. And so it appeared to me, for
      the Germans were dropping their shells from the southeast, at least one
      kilometer over range. We were standing beside a strawstack and looking
      due south, watching the just discernible line of French guns, when we
      heard the ominous whistling screech of an approaching shell. Down on our
      faces behind the stack, down we went like lightning, and over to the
      left, not 200 yards away, rose a huge column of black smoke and earth,
      and just afterward a very loud boom. A big German gun had come into
      action, slightly nearer this time.</p>

      <p>Just behind a wood I could plainly see the smoke of the gun itself
      rising above the trees. Two more shells from the big gun exploded within
      twenty yards of each other, and then, with disconcerting suddenness, a
      French battery came into action within a hundred yards of our strawstack
      cover. They had evidently been there for some time, awaiting
      eventualities, for we had no suspicion of their proximity, and they were
      completely hidden.</p>

      <p>My ears are still tingling and buzzing from the sound of those guns.
      One after another the guns of this battery bombarded the newly taken up
      position of the German big guns, which replied with one shell every three
      minutes.</p>

      <p>Presently we had the satisfaction of hearing a violent explosion in
      the wood, and a column of smoke and flame rose up to a great height.</p>

      <p>Soixante-quinze had again scored, for the German guns had been put out
      of action. From out the French position came infantry, at this point
      thousands of little dots over the landscape, presenting a front of, I
      should think, about two miles, rapidly advancing in skirmishing order.
      Every now and then the sharp crackle of rifle fire could distinctly be
      heard.</p>

      <p>The French had advanced over a mile, and the Germans had hastily
      evacuated the wood. Other French batteries now came into action, and the
      German fire over the whole arc was becoming decidedly fainter and less
      frequent. This might, of course, be due to changing their positions on
      the German front.</p>

      <p>Wounded began to arrive, which showed that for the present at any
      rate, it was safe to go out to the trenches to collect them.</p>

      <p>Very few of them seemed badly hit, and the wounded French artillerymen
      seemed to be elated in spite of their wounds. Had not their beloved
      Soixante-quinze again scored? The time was 6 o'clock of a beautiful
      evening and the firing, though fairly continuous, was dropping off. The
      Germans had changed their positions and it was getting a little too hazy
      to make observation, although a French aeroplane was seen descending in
      wide circles over the German position, evidently quite regardless of the
      numerous small balls of smoke, which made their appearance in the sky in
      dangerous proximity to the daring pilot.</p>

      <p>It is very interesting to watch these aeroplane shells bursting in the
      air. First of all one sees a vivid little streak of bluish white light in
      the sky, and then instantaneously a smoke ball, which appears to be about
      the size of a football, is seen in the sky, always fairly close to the
      machine. Then there is the sound of an explosion like a giant
      cracker.</p>

      <p>Occasionally several guns will fire at about the same time, and it is
      weird to watch the various balls of smoke, apparently coming into being
      from nowhere, all around the machine. Sometimes one of these shells,
      which are filled with a species of shrapnel, bursts rather unpleasantly
      near the aeroplane, and then one sees the machine turn quickly and rise a
      little higher.</p>

      <p>Two or three holes have been neatly drilled through the planes.
      Perhaps one has appeared in the body of the machine, rather too near the
      pilot for safety; but it is a big gamble, anyhow, and besides the pilot
      has been instructed to find out where the various positions are, and he
      means to do it.</p>

      <p>So he simply rises a little higher and calmly continues his big
      circles over the German position.</p>

      <p>I take off my hat to these brave men, the aeroplane pilots. They are
      willing to chance their luck. What matters it if their machine gets hit,
      if the planes are riddled with holes? It will still fly, even if the
      engine gets a fatal wound and stops.</p>

      <p>The pilot, if he is high enough, can still glide to safety in his own
      lines. But (and it is a big "but") should a shrapnel ball find its billet
      in the pilot&mdash;well, one has only to die once, and it is a quick and sure
      death to fall with one's machine.</p>

      <h3>The Battles in Belgium</h3>

      <p class="h3">[An Associated Press Dispatch.]</p>

      <p>LONDON, Oct. 26, 4:40 A.M.&mdash;The correspondent of The Daily News,
      who has been in an armored train to the banks of the Yser, gives a good
      description of the battle in the North. He says:</p>

      <p>"The battle rages along the Yser with frightful destruction of life.
      Air engines, sea engines, and land engines deathsweep this desolate
      country, vertically, horizontally, and transversely. Through it the frail
      little human engines crawl and dig, walk and run, skirmishing, charging,
      and blundering in little individual fights and tussles, tired and
      puzzled, ordered here and there, sleeping where they can, never washing,
      and dying unnoticed. A friend may find himself firing on a friendly
      force, and few are to blame.</p>

      <p>"Thursday the Germans were driven back over the Yser; Friday they
      secured a footing again, and Saturday they were again hurled back. Now a
      bridge blown up by one side is repaired by the other; it is again blown
      up by the first, or left as a death trap till the enemy is actually
      crossing.</p>

      <p>"Actions by armored trains, some of them the most reckless adventures,
      are attempted daily. Each day accumulates an unwritten record of
      individual daring feats, accepted as part of the daily work. Day by day
      our men push out on these dangerous explorations, attacked by shell fire,
      in danger of cross-fire, dynamite, and ambuscades, bringing a priceless
      support to the threatened lines. As the armored train approaches the
      river under shell fire the car cracks with the constant thunder of guns
      aboard. It is amazing to see the angle at which the guns can be
      swung.</p>

      <p>"And overhead the airmen are busy venturing through fog and puffs of
      exploding shells to get one small fact of information. We used to regard
      the looping of the loop of the Germans overhead as a hare-brained piece
      of impudent defiance to our infantry fire. Now we know its means early
      trouble for the infantry.</p>

      <p>"Besides us, as we crawl up snuffing the lines like dogs on a scent,
      grim trainloads of wounded wait soundlessly in the sidings. Further up
      the line ambulances are coming slowly back. The bullets of machine guns
      begin to rattle on our armored coats. Shells we learned to disregard, but
      the machine gun is the master in this war.</p>

      <p>"Now we near the river at a flat country farm. The territory is
      scarred with trenches, and it is impossible to say at first who is in
      them, so incidental and separate are the fortunes of this riverside
      battle. The Germans are on our bank enfilading the lines of the Allies'
      trenches. We creep up and the Germans come into sight out of the
      trenches, rush to the bank, and are scattered and mashed. The Allies
      follow with a fierce bayonet charge.</p>

      <p>"The Germans do not wait. They rush to the bridges and are swept away
      by the deadliest destroyer of all, the machine gun. The bridge is blown
      up, but who can say by whom. Quickly the train runs back.</p>

      <p>"'A brisk day,' remarks the correspondent. 'Not so bad,' replies the
      officer. So the days pass."</p>

      <p>The Telegraph's correspondent in Belgium, who, accompanied by a son of
      the Belgian War Minister, M. de Broqueville, made a tour of the
      battleground in the Dixmude district last Wednesday, says:</p>

      <p>"No pen could do justice to the grandeur and horror of the scene. As
      far as the eye could reach nothing could be seen but burning villages and
      bursting shells. I realized for the first time how completely the motor
      car had revolutionized warfare and how every other factor was now
      dominated by the absence or presence of this unique means of
      transport.</p>

      <p>"Every road to the front was simply packed with cars. They seemed an
      ever-rolling, endless stream, going and returning to the front, while in
      many villages hundreds of private cars were parked under the control of
      the medical officer, waiting in readiness to carry the wounded.</p>

      <p>"Arrived at the firing line, a terrible scene presented itself. The
      shell fire from the German batteries was so terrific that Belgian
      soldiers and French marines were continually being blown out of their
      dugouts and sent scattering to cover. Elsewhere, also, little groups of
      peasants were forced to flee because their cellars began to fall in.
      These unfortunates had to make their way as best they could on foot to
      the rear. They were frightened to death by the bursting shells, and the
      sight of crying children among them was most pathetic.</p>

      <p>"Dixmude was the objective of the German attack, and shells were
      bursting all over it, crashing among the roofs and blowing whole streets
      to pieces. From a distance of three miles we could hear them crashing
      down, but the town itself was invisible, except for the flames and the
      smoke and clouds rising above it. The Belgians had only a few field
      batteries, so that the enemy's howitzers simply dominated the field, and
      the infantry trenches around the town had to rely upon their own unaided
      efforts.</p>

      <p>"Our progress along the road was suddenly stopped by one of the most
      horrible sights I have ever seen. A heavy howitzer shell had fallen and
      burst right in the midst of a Belgian battery, making its way to the
      front, causing terrible destruction. The mangled horses and men among the
      d&eacute;bris presented a shocking spectacle.</p>

      <p>"Eventually, we got into Dixmude itself, and every time a shell came
      crashing among the roofs we thought our end had come. The H&ocirc;tel de
      Ville (town hall) was a sad sight. The roof was completely riddled by
      shell, while inside was a scene of chaos. It was piled with loaves of
      bread, bicycles, and dead soldiers.</p>

      <p>"The battle redoubled in fury, and by 7 o'clock in the evening Dixmude
      was a furnace, presenting a scene of terrible grandeur. The horizon was
      red with burning homes.</p>

      <p>"Our return journey was a melancholy one, owing to the constant trains
      of wounded that were passing."</p>

      <p>The Daily Mail's Rotterdam correspondent, telegraphing Sunday evening,
      says:</p>

      <p>"Slowly but surely the Germans are being beaten back on the western
      wing, and old men and young lads are being hurried to the front. The
      enemy were in strong force at Dixmude, where the Allies were repulsed
      once, only to attack again with renewed vigor.</p>

      <p>"Roulers resembles a shambles. It was taken and retaken four times,
      and battered to ruins in the process. The German guns made the place
      untenable for the Allies.</p>

      <p>"An Oosburg message says the firing at Ostend is very heavy, and that
      the British are shelling the suburbs, which are held by the Germans.
      Last night and this morning large bodies of Germans left Bruges for
      Ostend. It is believed the Ostend piers have been blown up."</p>

      <p>"The position on the coast is stationary this morning," says a Daily
      Mail dispatch from Flushing, Netherlands, under date of Sunday. "There is
      less firing and it is more to the southward. No alteration of the
      situation is reported from Ostend.</p>

      <p>"The German losses are frightful. Three meadows near Ostend are heaped
      with dead. The wounded are now installed in private houses in Bruges,
      where large wooden sheds are being rushed up to receive additional
      injured. Thirty-seven farm wagons containing wounded, dying, and dead
      passed in one hour near Middelkerke.</p>

      <p>"The Germans have been working at new intrenchments between Coq sur
      Mer and Wenduyne to protect their road to Bruges."</p>

      <p>Gen. von Tripp and nearly all his staff, who were killed in a church
      tower at Leffinghe by the fire from the British warships, have been
      buried in Ostend.</p>

      <h3>Seeking Wounded on Battle Front</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Philip Gibbs of The London Daily Chronicle.</b></p>

      <p>FURNES, Belgium, Oct. 21.&mdash;The staff of the English hospital, to
      which a mobile column has been attached for field work, has arrived here
      with a convoy of ambulances and motor cars. This little party of doctors,
      nurses, stretcher-bearers, and chauffeurs, under the direction of Dr.
      Bevis and Dr. Munro, has done splendid work in Belgium, and many of them
      were in the siege of Antwerp.</p>

      <p>Miss Macnaughton, the novelist, was one of those who went through this
      great test of courage, and Lady Dorothie Feilding, one of Lord Denbigh's
      daughters, won everybody's love by her gallantry and plucky devotion to
      duty in many perilous hours. She takes all risks with laughing courage.
      She has been under fire in many hot skirmishes, and has helped bring away
      the wounded from the fighting around Ghent when her own life might have
      paid the forfeit for defiance to bursting shells.</p>

      <p>This morning a flying column of the hospital was preparing to set out
      in search of wounded men on the firing line under direction of Lieut. de
      Broqueville, son of the Belgian War Minister. The Lieutenant, very cool
      and debonair, was arranging the order of the day with Dr. Munro. Lady
      Dorothie Feilding and the two other women in field kit stood by their
      cars, waiting for the password. There were four stretcher-bearers,
      including Mr. Gleeson, an American, who has worked with this party around
      Ghent and Antwerp, proving himself to be a man of calm and quiet courage
      at a critical moment, always ready to take great risks in order to bring
      in a wounded man.</p>

      <p>It was decided to take three ambulances and two motor cars. Lieut. de
      Broqueville anticipated a heavy day's work. He invited me to accompany
      the column in a car which I shared with Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett of The
      London Daily Telegraph, who also volunteered for the expedition.</p>

      <p>We set out before noon, winding our way through the streets of Furnes.
      We were asked to get into Dixmude, where there were many wounded. It is
      about ten miles away from Furnes. As we went along the road, nearer to
      the sound of the great guns which for the last hour or two had been
      firing incessantly, we passed many women and children. They were on their
      way to some place further from the firing. Poor old grandmothers in black
      bonnets and skirts trudged along the lines of poplars with younger women,
      who clasped their babies tightly in one hand, while with the other they
      carried heavy bundles of household goods.</p>

      <p>Along the road came German prisoners, marching rapidly between mounted
      guards. Many of them were wounded, and all of them had a wild, famished,
      terror-stricken look.</p>

      <p>At a turn in the road the battle lay before us, and we were in the
      zone of fire. Away across the fields was a line of villages with the town
      of Dixmude a little to the right of us, perhaps a mile and a quarter
      away.  From each little town smoke was rising in separate columns which
      met at the top in a great black pall. At every moment this blackness was
      brightened by puffs of electric blue, extraordinarily vivid, as shells
      burst in the air. From the mass of houses in each town came jets of
      flame, following explosions which sounded with terrific thudding shocks.
      On a line of about nine miles there was an incessant cannonade. The
      farthest villages were already on fire.</p>

      <p>Quite close to us, only about half a mile across the fields to the
      left, there were Belgian batteries at work and rifle fire from many
      trenches.  We were between two fires, and Belgian and German shells came
      screeching over our heads. The German shells were dropping quite close to
      us, plowing up the fields with great pits. We could hear them burst and
      scatter and could see them burrow.</p>

      <p>In front of us on the road lay a dreadful barrier, which brought us to
      a halt. A German shell had fallen right on top of an ammunition convoy.
      Four horses had been blown to pieces and their carcasses lay strewn
      across the road. The ammunition wagon had been broken into fragments and
      smashed and burned to cinders by the explosion of its own shells. A
      Belgian soldier lay dead, cut in half by a great fragment of steel.
      Further along the road were two other dead horses in pools of blood. It
      was a horrible and sickening sight, from which one turned away shuddering
      with cold sweat, but we had to pass it after some of this dead flesh had
      been dragged away.</p>

      <p>Further down the road we had left two of the cars in charge of Lady
      Dorothie Feilding and her two nurses. They were to wait there until we
      brought back some of the wounded. Two ambulances came on with our light
      car, commanded by Lieut. Broqueville and Dr. Munro. Mr. Gleeson asked me
      to help him as stretcher-bearer. Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett was to work with
      one of the other stretcher-bearers.</p>

      <p>I was in one of the ambulances, and Mr. Gleeson sat behind me in the
      narrow space between the stretchers. Over his shoulder he talked in a
      quiet voice of the job that lay before us. I was glad of that quiet
      voice, so placid in its courage. We went forward at what seemed to me a
      crawl, though I think it was a fair pace, shells bursting around us now
      on all sides, while shrapnel bullets sprayed the earth about us. It
      appeared to me an odd thing that we were still alive. Then we came into
      Dixmude.</p>

      <p>When I saw it for the first and last time it was a place of death and
      horror. The streets through which we passed were utterly deserted and
      wrecked from end to end, as though by an earthquake. Incessant explosions
      of shell fire crashed down upon the walls which still stood.  Great
      gashes opened in the walls, which then toppled and fell. A roof came
      tumbling down with an appalling clatter. Like a house of cards blown by a
      puff of wind, a little shop suddenly collapsed into a mass of ruins. Here
      and there, further into the town, we saw living figures.  They ran
      swiftly for a moment and then disappeared into dark caverns under
      toppling porticos. They were Belgian soldiers.</p>

      <p>We were now in a side street leading into the Town Hall square. It
      seemed impossible to pass, owing to the wreckage strewn across the road.
      "Try to take it," said Dr. Munro, who was sitting beside the chauffeur.
      We took it, bumping over heaps of d&eacute;bris, and then swept around
      into the square. It was a spacious place, with the Town Hall at one side
      of it&mdash;or what was left of the Town Hall; there was only the
      splendid shell of it left, sufficient for us to see the skeleton of a
      noble building which had once been the pride of Flemish craftsmen. Even
      as we turned toward it parts of it were falling upon the ruins already on
      the ground.  I saw a great pillar lean forward and then topple down. A
      mass of masonry crashed from the portico. Some stiff, dark forms lay
      among the fallen stones; they were dead soldiers. I hardly glanced at
      them, for we were in search of the living.</p>

      <p>Our cars were brought to a halt outside the building, and we all
      climbed down. I lighted a cigarette, and I noticed two of the other men
      fumble for matches for the same purpose. We wanted something to steady
      our nerves. There was never a moment when shell fire was not bursting in
      that square. Shrapnel bullets whipped the stones. The Germans were making
      a target of the Town Hall and dropping their shells with dreadful
      exactitude on either side of it.</p>

      <p>I glanced toward the flaming furnace to the right of the building.
      There was a wonderful glow at the heart of it, yet it did not give me any
      warmth. At that moment Dr. Munro and Lieut. de Broqueville mounted the
      steps of the Town Hall, followed by Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett and myself. Mr.
      Gleeson was already taking down a stretcher; he had a little smile about
      his lips.</p>

      <p>A French officer and two men stood under the broken archway of the
      entrance, between the fallen pillars and masonry. A yard away from them
      lay a dead soldier, a handsome young man with clear-cut features turned
      upward to the gaping roof. A stream of blood was coagulating around his
      head, but did not touch the beauty of his face. Another dead man lay
      huddled up quite close, and his face was hidden.</p>

      <p>"Are there any wounded here, Sir?" asked our young Lieutenant. The
      other officer spoke excitedly. He was a brave man, but he could not hide
      the terror in his soul, because he had been standing so long waiting for
      death, which stood beside him, but did not touch him. It appeared from
      his words that there were several wounded men among the dead down in the
      cellar, and that he would be obliged to us if we could rescue them.</p>

      <p>We stood on some steps, looking down into that cellar. It was a dark
      hole, illumined dimly by a lantern, I think. I caught sight of a little
      heap of huddled bodies. Two soldiers, still unwounded, dragged three of
      them out and handed them up to us. The work of getting those three men
      into the first ambulance seemed to us interminable; it was really no more
      than fifteen or twenty minutes. During that time Dr. Munro, perfectly
      calm and quiet, was moving about the square, directing the work. Lieut.
      de Broqueville was making inquiries about other wounded in other houses.
      I lent a hand to one of the stretcher-bearers. What the others were doing
      I do not know, except that Mr. Gleeson's calm face made a clear-cut image
      on my brain.</p>

      <p>I had lost consciousness of myself. Something outside myself, as it
      seemed, was saying that there was no way of escape; that it was monstrous
      to suppose that all these bursting shells would not smash the ambulance
      to bits and finish the agony of the wounded, and that death was very
      hideous. I remember thinking, also, how ridiculous it was for men to kill
      one another like this and to make such hells on earth.</p>

      <p>Then Lieut. de Broqueville spoke a word of command; the first
      ambulance must now get back. I was with the first ambulance, in Mr.
      Gleeson's company. We had a full load of wounded men, and we were
      loitering. I put my head outside the cover and gave the word to the
      chauffeur. As I did so a shrapnel bullet came past my head, and, striking
      a piece of ironwork, flattened out and fell at my feet. I picked it up
      and put it in my pocket, though God alone knows why, for I was not in
      search of souvenirs.</p>

      <p>So we started with the first ambulance through those frightful streets
      again and out into the road to the country. "Very hot!" said one of the
      men&mdash;I think it was the chauffeur. Somebody else asked if we should
      get through with luck. Nobody answered the question. The wounded men with
      us were very quiet; I thought they were dead. There was only an incessant
      cannonade and the crashing of buildings. The mitrailleuses were at work
      now, spitting out bullets. It was a worse sound than that of the shells;
      it seemed more deadly in its rattle. I started back behind the car and
      saw the other ambulance in our wake. I did not see the motor car.</p>

      <p>Along the country roads the fields were still being plowed by shells
      which burst over our heads. We came to a halt again in a place where
      soldiers were crouched under cottage walls. There were few walls now, and
      inside some of the remaining cottages were many wounded men. Their
      comrades were giving them first aid and wiping the blood out of their
      eyes. We managed to take some of these on board. They were less quiet
      than the others we had, and groaned in a heartrending way.</p>

      <p>A little later we made a painful discovery&mdash;Lieut. de
      Broqueville, our gallant young leader, was missing. By some horrible
      mischance he had not taken his place in either of the ambulances or the
      motor cars. None of us had the least idea what had happened to him; we
      had all imagined that he had scrambled up like the rest of us, after
      giving the order to get away.</p>

      <p>There was only one thing to do&mdash;to get back in search of him.
      Even in the half hour since we had left the town Dixmude had burst into
      flames and was a great blazing torch. If de Broqueville were left in that
      hell he would not have a chance of life.</p>

      <p>It was Mr. Gleeson and Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett who, with great gallantry,
      volunteered to go back and search for our leader. They took the light car
      and sped back toward the burning town. The ambulances went on with their
      cargo of wounded, and Lady Dorothie Feilding and I were left alone for a
      little time in one of the cars. We drove back along the road toward
      Dixmude, and rescued another wounded man left in a wayside cottage.</p>

      <p>By this time there were five towns blazing in the darkness, and in
      spite of the awful suspense which we were now suffering we could not help
      staring at the fiendish splendor of that sight.</p>

      <p>Dr. Munro joined us again, and after consultation we decided to get as
      near to Dixmude as we could, in case our friends had to come out without
      their car or had been wounded.</p>

      <p>The German bombardment was now terrific. All the guns were
      concentrated upon Dixmude and the surrounding trenches. In the darkness
      under a stable wall I stood listening to the great crashes for an hour,
      when I had not expected such a lease of life. Inside the stable soldiers
      were sleeping in the straw, careless that at any moment a shell might
      burst through upon them. The hour seemed a night; then we saw the gleam
      of headlights, and an English voice called out.</p>

      <p>Ashmead-Bartlett and Gleeson had come back. They had gone to the
      entrance to Dixmude, but could get no further, owing to the flames and
      shells. They, too, had waited for an hour, but had not found de
      Broqueville. It seemed certain that he was dead; and, very sorrowfully,
      as there was nothing to be done, we drove back to Furnes.</p>

      <p>At the gate of the convent were some Belgian ambulances which had come
      from another part of the front with their wounded. I helped to carry one
      of them in, and strained my shoulders with the weight of the stretcher.
      Another wounded man put his arm around my neck, and then, with a dreadful
      cry, collapsed, so that I had to hold him in a strong grip. A third man,
      horribly smashed about the head, walked almost unaided into the operating
      room. Mr. Gleeson and I led him with just a touch on his arm. This
      morning he lies dead on a little pile of straw in a quiet corner of the
      courtyard.</p>

      <p>I sat down to a supper, which I had not expected to eat. There was a
      strange excitement in my body, which trembled a little after the day's
      adventures. It seemed very strange to be sitting down to table with
      cheerful faces about me, but some of the faces were not cheerful. Those
      of us who knew of the disappearance of de Broqueville sat silently over
      our soup.</p>

      <p>Then suddenly Lady Dorothie Feilding gave a little cry of joy, and
      Lieut. de Broqueville came walking briskly forward. It seemed a miracle;
      it was hardly less than that. For several hours after our departure from
      Dixmude he had remained in that inferno. He had missed us when he went
      down into the cellar to haul out another wounded man, forgetting that he
      had given us the order to start. There he had remained, with buildings
      crashing all around him until the German fire had died down a little. He
      succeeded in rescuing his wounded man, for whom he found room in a
      Belgian ambulance outside the town and walked back along the road to
      Furnes.</p>

      <p>We clasped hands and were thankful for his escape. This morning he has
      gone again to what is left of Dixmude with a flying column. Dr. Munro and
      Mr. Gleeson, with Lady Dorothie Feilding and her friends, are in the
      party, although in Dixmude German infantry have taken possession of the
      outer ruins.</p>

      <p>The courage of this English field ambulance under the Belgian Red
      Cross is one of those splendid things which shine through this devil's
      work of war.</p>


      <h3>At the Kaiser's Headquarters</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Cyril Brown of The New York Times.</b></p>

      <p>GERMAN GREAT HEADQUARTERS IN FRANCE, Oct. 20.&mdash;The most
      vulnerable, vital spot of the whole German Empire is, paradoxically, in
      France&mdash;the small city on the Meuse where the Grosses Hauptquartier,
      the brains of the whole German fighting organism, has been located for
      the last few weeks. After a lucky dash through the forbidden zone of
      France held by the Germans I managed to pay a surprise visit to the Great
      Headquarters, where, among other interesting sights, I have already seen
      the Kaiser, the King of Saxony, the Crown Prince, Major Langhorne, the
      American Military Attach&eacute;; Field Marshal von Moltke, and shoals of
      lesser celebrities with which the town is overrun. My stay is of
      indeterminate length, and only until the polite but insistent pressure
      which the Kaiser's secret police and the General Staff are bringing to
      bear on their unbidden guest to leave becomes irresistible.</p>

      <p>It was a sometime <span class="pscaps">Times</span> reader, a German
      brakeman, who had worked in New York and was proud of being able to speak
      "American," who helped me to slip aboard the military postzug (post
      train) that left the important military centre of L&mdash;&mdash; at 1:30
      A.M. and started to crawl toward the front with a mixed cargo of snoring
      field chaplains, soldiers rejoining their units, officers with iron
      crosses pinned to their breasts, ambulance men who talked gruesome shop,
      fresh meat, surgical supplies, mail bags, &amp;c. Sometimes the train
      would spurt up to twelve miles an hour. There were long stops at every
      station, while unshaven Landsturm men on guard scanned the car windows in
      search of spies by the light of their electric flash lamps. After many
      hours somebody said we were now in Belgium.</p>

      <p>There are no longer any bothersome customs formalities at the Belgian
      border, but the ghost of a house that had been knocked into a cocked hat
      by a shell indicated that we were in the land of the enemy. Houses that
      looked as if they had been struck by a Western cyclone now became more
      numerous. A village church steeple had a jagged hole clean through it.
      After more hours somebody else said we were in France. Every bridge,
      culvert, and crossroad was guarded by heavily bearded Landsturm men, who
      all looked alike in their funny, antiquated, high black leather
      helmets&mdash;usually in twos&mdash;the countryside dotted with cheery
      little watch fires.</p>

      <p>In the little French villages all lights were out in the houses. The
      streets were barred like railroad crossings except that the poles were
      painted in red-white-black stripes, a lantern hanging from the middle of
      the barrier to keep the many army automobiles that passed in the night
      from running amuck.</p>

      <p>Sedan, a beehive of activity, was reached at daybreak. Here most of
      the military, plus the Field Chaplains, got out. From here on daylight
      showed the picturesque ruin the French themselves had wrought&mdash;the
      frequent tangled wreckage of dynamited steel railway bridges sticking out
      of the waters of the river, piles of shattered masonry damming the
      current, here and there half an arch still standing of a once beautiful
      stone footbridge. I was told that over two hundred bridges had been blown
      up by the retreating French in their hopeless attempt to delay the German
      advance in this part of France alone.</p>

      <p>Several hours more of creeping over improvised wooden bridges and
      restored roadbeds brought the post train to the French city that had
      20,000 inhabitants before the war which the Kaiser and the Great
      Headquarters now occupy.</p>

      <p>Wooden signs printed in black letters, "Verboten," (forbidden,) now
      ornament the pretty little park, with its fountain still playing, outside
      the railroad station. The paths are guarded by picked grenadiers, not
      Landsturm men this time, while an officer of the guard makes his
      ceaseless rounds. Opposite the railroad station, on the other side of the
      little park, is an unpretentious villa of red brick and terra cotta
      trimmings, but two guard houses painted with red-white-black stripes
      flank the front door and give it a look of importance. The street at
      either end is barred by red, white and black striped poles and strapping
      grenadiers on guard are clustered thick about it. You don't need to ask
      who lives there. The red brick house (it would not rent for more than
      $100 a month in any New York suburb) is the present temporary residence
      of the Over War Lord. Its great attraction for the Kaiser, I am told, is
      the large, secluded garden in the rear where this other "man of destiny"
      loves to walk and meditate or, more usually, talk&mdash;though the few
      remaining French inhabitants could have a frequent opportunity of seeing
      him walk in the little closed public park if they were interested, but
      the natives seem outwardly utterly apathetic.</p>

      <p>Several of the Kaiser's household, in green J&auml;ger uniforms, were
      lounging around the door for an early morning airing, while secret
      service men completed the picture by hovering in the immediate
      neighborhood. You can tell that they are German secret service agents
      because they all wear felt alpine hats, norfolk jackets, waterproof cloth
      capes and a bored expression. They have been away from Berlin for nearly
      three months now. About fifty of them constitute the "Secret Field
      Police" and their station house is half a block away from the Kaiser's
      residence.</p>

      <p>Just around the corner from the Kaiser, within a stone's throw of his
      back door, is another red-brick house with terra-cotta trimmings, rather
      larger and more imposing. The names of its new residents, "Hahnke,"
      "Caprivi," and "Graf von Moltke," are scrawled in white chalk on the
      stone post of the gateway. Further up the same street another chalk
      scrawl on a quite imposing mansion informed me that "The Imperial
      Chancellor" and "The Foreign Office" had set up shop there. Near by were
      Grand Admiral von Tirpitz's field quarters. A bank building on another
      principal street bore the sign, "War Cabinet."</p>

      <p>The Great General Staff occupies the quaint old Hotel de Ville. An
      unmolested ramble showed that all the best residences and business
      buildings in the heart of the town were required to house the members of
      the Great Headquarters, who number, in addition to the Kaiser and his
      personal entourage, thirty-six chiefs or department heads, including the
      Imperial Chancellor, the War Minister, the Chief of the Great General
      Staff, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Chief of the Ammunition
      Supply, the Chief of the Field Railways, the Chief of the Field Telephone
      and Telegraph Service, the Chief of the Sanitary Service, the Chief of
      the Volunteer Automobile Corps, &amp;c., making, with secretaries,
      clerks, ordonnances, and necessary garrison, a community of 1,200
      souls.</p>

      <p>I could not help wondering why the Allies' aviators weren't "on the
      job." A dozen, backed up by an intelligent Intelligence Department, could
      so obviously settle the fortunes of the war by blowing out the brains of
      their enemy. Perhaps that is why the whereabouts of the Great
      Headquarters is guarded as a jealous secret. The soldiers at the front
      don't know where it is, nor the man on the street at home, and, of
      course, its location is not breathed in the German press. Theoretically,
      only those immediately concerned are "in the know." Visitors are not
      allowed, neutral foreign correspondents are told by the authorities in
      Berlin that "it is impossible" to go to the Grosser Hauptquartier.</p>

      <p>Two aeroplane guns are mounted on the hills across the river at a
      point immediately opposite the Kaiser's residence, while near them a
      picked squad of sharpshooters is on the watch night and day for hostile
      fliers.  To further safeguard not only the person of the Kaiser but the
      brains of the fighting machine the spy hunt is kept up here with
      unrelenting pertinacity.</p>

      <p>"We went over the town with a fine-tooth comb and cleaned out all the
      suspicious characters the very first day we arrived," said a friendly
      detective.</p>

      <p>"There are no cranks or anarchists left here. Today the order is going
      out to arrest all men of military age&mdash;between 18 and 45&mdash;but
      there are few, if any, left. We also made a house-to-house search for
      arms and collected three wagonloads, mostly old.</p>

      <p>"Our Kaiser is as safe here now as he would be anywhere in Germany. We
      know every one who arrives and leaves town. It seems impossible for a spy
      to slip in and still more to slip out again through the lines&mdash;but
      we are always on the watch for the impossible. The fear of spies is not a
      delusion or a form of madness, as you suggest. Here is one case of my
      personal knowledge: A German Boy Scout of 16, who had learned to speak
      French and English perfectly at school, volunteered his services and was
      attached to the staff of an army corps. This young chap succeeded in
      slipping into Rheims, where he was able to locate the positions of the
      French batteries and machine guns, and make his way back to our lines
      with this invaluable information. For this feat the boy received the Iron
      Cross. After being in the field for six weeks he got home-sick, however,
      and has been allowed to go home for a visit."</p>

      <p>From a spectacular point of view the Great Headquarters is rather
      disappointing. A few mixed patrols of Uhlans, dragoons, and hussars
      occasionally ride through the principal streets to exercise their horses.
      Occasionally, too, you see a small squad of strapping grenadiers, who
      break into the goose step on the slightest provocation as when they pass
      a General or other officer of the Great General Staff, whom you recognize
      by the broad red stripes on their "field gray" trousers.</p>

      <p>There is no pomp or ceremony even when royalty is running around at
      large. Thus when the King of Saxony arrived in town, a few hours after I
      did, no fuss was made whatever. The Saxon King and his staff, three
      touring car loads, all in field gray, drove straight to the villa
      assigned them, and, after reciprocal informal visits between King and
      Kaiser, the former left to visit some of the battlefields on which Saxon
      troops had fought, and later paid a visit to his troops at the front.
      For this exploit, the Kaiser promptly bestowed on him the Iron Cross,
      first and second class, on his return to town.</p>

      <p>Even the Kaiser's heart is not covered with medals, nor does he wear
      the gorgeous white plume parade helmet nowadays, when going out for a
      horse-back ride or a drive. I saw him come from a motor run late in the
      afternoon&mdash;four touring cars full of staff officers and personal
      entourage&mdash;and was struck by the complete absence of pomp and ceremony.
      In the second car sat the Kaiser, wearing the dirty green-gray uniform of
      his soldiers in the field. At a distance of fifteen feet, the Over War
      Lord looked physically fit, but quite sober&mdash;an intense earnestness of
      expression that seemed to mirror the sternness of the times.</p>

      <p>The Kaiser goes for a daily drive or ride about the countryside
      usually in the afternoon, but occasionally he is allowed to have a real
      outing by his solicitous entourage&mdash;a day and more rarely a
      [<i>Transcriber: text missing in original</i>]</p>

      <p>"His Majesty is never so happy as when he is among his troops at the
      front," another transplanted Berlin detective told me. "If his Majesty
      had his way he would be among them all the time, preferably sleeping
      under canvas and roughing it like the rest&mdash;eating the 'simple' food
      prepared by his private field kitchen. But his life is too valuable to be
      risked in that way, and his personal Adjutant, von Plessen, who watches
      over his Majesty like a mother or a governess, won't let him go to the
      front often. His Majesty loves his soldiers and would be among them right
      up at the firing line if he were not constantly watched and kept in check
      by his devoted von Plessen." However, the Kaiser sleeps within earshot of
      the not very distant thunder of the German heavy artillery pounding away
      at Rheims, plainly heard here at night when the wind blows from the right
      direction.</p>

      <p>Of barbarism or brutality the writer saw no signs, either here or at
      other French villages occupied by the Germans. The behavior of the common
      soldiers toward the natives is exemplary and in most cases kindly. There
      are many touches of human interest. I saw about a hundred of the most
      destitute hungry townsfolk, mostly women with little children, hanging
      around one of the barracks at the outskirts of the town until after
      supper the German soldiers came out and distributed the remnants of their
      black bread rations to them. It is not an uncommon sight to see staff
      officers as well as soldiers stopping on the streets to hand out small
      alms to the begging women and children. Many of the shops in town were
      closed and boarded up at the approach of the Prussians, but small hotel
      keepers, caf&eacute; proprietors, and tradesmen who had the nerve to
      remain and keep open are very well satisfied with the German invasion in
      one way, for they never made so much money before in their lives. Most of
      the German soldiers garrisoned here have picked up a few useful words of
      French; all of them can, and do, call for wine, white or red, in the
      vernacular. Moreover, they pay for all
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'them']">they</ins>
      consume. I was astonished to see even the detectives paying real money
      for what they drank. Several tradesmen told me they had suffered chiefly
      at the hands of the French soldiers themselves, who had helped themselves
      freely to their stock before retreating, without paying, saying it was no
      use to leave good wine, for the Prussian swine.</p>

      <p>I had not prowled around the Great Headquarters for many hours when
      the Secret Field Police, patrolling all the streets, showed signs of
      curiosity, and to forestall the orthodox arrest and march to headquarters
      (already
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'experience']">experienced</ins>
      once, in Cologne) waited upon Lieut. Col. von Hahnke, Military Commandant
      of the city, and secured immunity in the form of the Commandant's
      signature on a scrap of paper stamped in purple ink with the Prussian
      eagle. Commandant Hahnke, after expressing the opinion that it was good
      that American newspaper men were coming to Germany to see for themselves,
      and hoping that "the truth" was beginning to become known on the other
      side, courteously sent his Adjutant along to get me past the guard at the
      Great General Staff and introduce me to Major Nikolai, Chief of Division
      III.  B., in charge of newspaper correspondents and Military Attach&eacute;s.
      Here, however, the freedom of the American press came into hopeless, but
      humorous, collision with the Prussian militarism.</p>

      <p>"Who are you? What are you doing here? How did you get here?" snapped
      the Prussian Major. A kind letter of introduction from Ambassador Gerard,
      requesting "all possible courtesy and assistance from the authorities of
      the countries through which he may pass," and emblazoned with the red
      seal of the United States of America, which had worked like magic on all
      previous occasions, had no effect on Major Nikolai. Neither had a letter
      from the American Consul at Cologne, nor a letter of introduction to Gen.
      von Buelow, nor any one of a dozen other impressive documents produced in
      succession for his benefit.</p>

      <p>"No foreign correspondents are permitted to be at the Great
      Headquarters. None has been allowed to come here. If we allow one to
      remain, fifty others will want to come, and we should be unable to keep
      an eye on all of them," he explained. "You must go back to Berlin at
      once."</p>

      <p>Reluctant permission was finally obtained to remain one night on the
      possibly unwarranted intimation that the great American people would
      consider it a "national affront" if an American newspaperman was not
      allowed to stay and see the American Military Attach&eacute;, Major
      Langhorne, who was away on a sightseeing tour near Verdun, but would be
      back in the morning. However, a long cross-examination had to be
      undergone at the hands of the venerable Herr Chief of the Secret Field
      Police Bauer, who was taking no chances at harboring an English spy in
      the Houptquartier disguised as a correspondent.</p>

      <p>I found Major Langhorne standing the strain of the <ins
         class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original
         'compaign']">campaign</ins> well, and I gathered the impression that
      he intended to see the thing through, and that there was much which
      America could learn from the titanic operations of the Germans. Major
      Langhorne and the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Spanish, Rumanian, and
      Swedish military attach&eacute;s are luxuriously quartered a mile and a
      half out of town in the handsome villa of M. Noll, the landscape painter,
      present whereabouts unknown. The attach&eacute;s all have a sense of
      humor, "otherwise," said one of them, "we could never stand being cooped
      up here together." The gardener's daughter, a pretty young Frenchwoman,
      the only servant who remained behind when the household fled at the
      approach of the Germans, is both cook and housekeeper, and when I arrived
      I found the seven military attach&eacute;s resolved into a board of
      strategy trying to work out the important problem of securing a pure milk
      supply for her four-month-old baby.</p>

      <p>Work consists of occasional motor runs to various points along the
      long front. I was told that recently Major Langhorne ran into some heavy
      shrapnel and shell fire, and was lucky to get away with a whole skin.
      When asked to tell about it, Major Langhorne passed it off laughingly as
      "all in the day's work."</p>

      <p>In spite of the fact that they are engaged in keeping their end up in
      a life-and-death fight for national existence, the Great General Staff
      has found time to give the American Military Attach&eacute; every possible
      opportunity to see actual fighting.</p>

      <p>The foreign military attach&eacute;s have made many of their
      expeditions in company with the small band of German war correspondents,
      who live in another villa close by, under the constant chaperonage of
      Major von Rohrscheldt. They are allowed to see much, but send little. The
      relative position of the press in Germany is indicated by the fact that
      these German war correspondents are nicknamed "hunger candidates." A
      military expert who was well posted on American journalism explained to
      me, however, that the very tight censorship lid was not for the purpose
      of withholding news from the German people, but to keep valuable
      information from being handed to the enemy. He pointed out that the
      laconic German official dispatches dealt only with things actually
      accomplished, and were very bare of detail, while, on the other hand, the
      French and English press had been worth more than several army corps to
      the Germans, concluding, "It may be poor journalism, but it's the right
      way to make war."</p>

      <p class="center">KAISERIN'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION.</p>

      <p>Oct. 22.&mdash;It was hard to realize today that a great war was going
      on.  Every building in town occupied by the Germans was decorated with
      the German flag in honor of the Kaiserin's birthday, and at night the
      principal ones, including that occupied by the "War Cabinet," were
      specially illuminated. All morning long, quantities of Generals came
      rolling up in touring cars to the Kaiser's door to pay their homage and
      offer congratulations. About noon the Crown Prince and staff arrived by
      motor from the direction of the headquarters of his army. The Crown
      Prince, who characteristically sat on the front seat next to the
      chauffeur, looked as boyish and immature as his former pictures&mdash;his
      military cap cocked slightly on one side. The responsibility of leading
      an army had apparently not had a sobering effect on the Crown Prince as
      yet, but I was told that the guiding brain and genius in the Crown
      Prince's army headquarters was not that of the Crown Prince, but of his
      chief adviser, Gen. von Haeseler, the brilliant cavalry leader of the war
      of 1870 and now the "grand old man" of the German Army, sharing with von
      Zeppelin the distinction of being the oldest living German Generals.  It
      seemed still harder to realize that men were fighting and dying not fifty
      miles away when, after luncheon, Kaiser, Crown Prince, and staffs went
      for a two hours' automobile ride, the Crown Prince leaving late in the
      afternoon to rejoin his command.</p>

      <p>The only warlike notes in the day's picture were a German military
      aeroplane&mdash;one of the famous Taubes&mdash;that flew at a high
      altitude over the Great Headquarters toward the enemies' lines; a
      battalion of Saxon Landsturm that rested for an hour at the railroad
      station, then started on the final hike for the front, refreshed by a
      glimpse of their motoring Kaiser, and toward evening four automobile
      loads of wounded German officers, who arrived from the direction of
      Rheims, where it was rumored the French had made four desperate attempts
      to break through.</p>

      <p>Here one gets more and more the impression that the Germans in their
      war-making have learned a lesson from the hustling Americans&mdash;that
      they have managed to graft American speed to their native thoroughness,
      making a combination hard to beat. For instance, there is a regular relay
      service of high-power racing motor cars between the Great Headquarters
      and Berlin, the schedule calling for a total running time of something
      under a day and a half, beating the best time at present possible by
      train by four hours. One of the picked drivers, who has the last
      lap&mdash;through France&mdash;said his running schedule required him to
      average sixty miles an hour, and this running at night. A network of fast
      relay automobile services is also run from the Great Headquarters,
      through Belgium, linking up Brussels and Antwerp, and to the principal
      points on the long line of battle.</p>

      <p>How great a r&ocirc;le the motor car plays among the Germans may be
      gathered from an estimate made to the writer that 40,000 cars were in use
      for military purposes. Many thousands of these are private automobiles
      operated by their wealthy owners as members of the Volunteer War
      Automobile Corps, of which Prince Waldemar, son of the sailor Prince
      Henry, is chief. Their ranks include many big business men, captains of
      industry, and men of social prominence and professional eminence.</p>

      <p>They wear a distinctive uniform, that of an infantry officer, with a
      collar of very dark red, and a short, purely ornamental sword or
      dagger.</p>

      <hr class="minor" />

      <p class="center">BACK TO LUXEMBURG.</p>

      <p>LUXEMBURG, Oct. 24.&mdash;I have just returned from the German Great
      Headquarters in France, the visit terminating abruptly on the fourth day,
      when one of the Kaiser's secret field police woke me up at 7 o'clock in
      the morning and regretfully said that his instructions were to see that I
      "did not oversleep" the first train out. The return journey along one of
      the German main lines of communication&mdash;through Eastern France,
      across a corner of Belgium and through Luxemburg&mdash;was full of
      interest, and confirmed the impression gathered at the centre of things,
      the Great Headquarters, that this twentieth century warfare is in the
      last analysis a gigantic business proposition which the Board of
      Directors (the Great General Staff) and the thirty-six department heads
      are conducting with the efficiency of a great American business
      corporation.</p>

      <p>The west-bound track is a continuous procession of freight
      trains&mdash;fresh consignments of raw material&mdash;men and
      ammunition&mdash;being rushed to the firing line to be ground out into
      victories. The first shipment we pass is an infantry
      battalion&mdash;first ten flatcars loaded with baggage, ammunition,
      provision wagons, and field kitchens, the latter already with fire
      lighted and soup cooking as the long train steams slowly along, for the
      trenches are only fifty miles away, and the Germans make a point of
      sending their troops into battle with full stomachs.</p>

      <p>After the flatcars come thirty box cars, all decorated with green
      branches and scrawled over with chalked witticism at the expense of the
      French and Russians. The men cheer as our train passes. A few kilometers
      further backed on to a siding, is a train of some twenty flatcars, each
      loaded with a touring car. Then we pass a battery of artillery on
      flatcars, the guns still garlanded with flowers; then a short freight
      train&mdash;six cars loaded with nothing but spare automobile
      tires&mdash;then a long train of heavy motor trucks, then more infantry
      trains, then an empty hospital train going back for another load, then a
      train of gasoline tank cars, more cheering infantry, more artillery,
      another empty hospital train, a pioneer train, a score of flatcars loaded
      with long, heavy piles, beams, steel girders, bridge spans, and lumber,
      then a passenger train load of German railway officials and servants
      going to operate the railways toward the coast, more infantry, food
      trains, ammunition trains, train loads of railway tracks already bolted
      to metal ties and merely needing to be laid down and pieced together, and
      so on in endless succession all through France and through Belgium. The
      two-track road, shaky in spots, especially when crossing rivers, is being
      worked to capacity, and how well the huge traffic is handled is
      surprising even to an American commuter.</p>

      <p>Our fast train stops at the mouth of a tunnel, then crawls ahead
      charily, for the French, before retreating, dynamited the tunnel. One
      track has been cleared, but the going is still bad. To keep it from being
      blocked again by falling d&eacute;bris the Germans have dug clean through
      the top of the hill, opening up a deep well of light into the tunnel.
      Looking up, you see a pioneer company in once cream-colored, now
      dirty-colored, fatigue uniform still digging away and terracing the sides
      of the big hole to prevent slides. Half an hour later we go slow again in
      crossing a new wooden bridge over the Meuse&mdash;only one track as yet.
      It took the German pioneers nearly a week to build the substitute for the
      old steel railway bridge dynamited by the French, whose four spans lie
      buckled up in the river. The pioneers are at work driving piles to carry
      a second track. The process is interesting. A forty-man-power pile driver
      is rigged upon the bow end of a French river barge with forty soldiers
      tugging at forty strands of the main rope.  The "gang" foreman, a Captain
      in field gray, stands on the river bank and bellows the word of command.
      Up goes the heavy iron weight; another command, and down it drops on the
      pile. It looks like a painfully slow process, but the bridges are rebuilt
      just the same.</p>

      <p>Further on, a variety of interest is furnished to a squad of French
      prisoners being marched along the road. Then a spot of ant-hill-like
      activity where a German railway company is at work building a new branch
      line, hundreds of them having pickaxes and making the dirt fly. You half
      expect to see a swearing Irish foreman. It looks like home&mdash;all
      except the inevitable officer (distinguished by revolver and field glass)
      shouting commands.</p>

      <p>The intense activity of the Germans in rebuilding the torn-up
      railroads and pushing ahead new strategic lines, is one of the most
      interesting features of a tour now in France. I was told that they had
      pushed the railroad work so far that they were able to ship men and
      ammunition almost up to the fortified trenches. The Germanization of the
      railroads here has been completed by the importation of station
      Superintendents, station hands, track walkers, &amp;c., from the
      Fatherland.  The stretch over which we are traveling, for example, is in
      charge of Bavarians. The Bavarian and German flags hang out at every
      French station we pass.  German signs everywhere, even German time. It
      looks as if they thought to stay forever.</p>

      <p>Now we creep past a long hospital train, full this time, which has
      turned out on a siding to give us the right of way&mdash;perhaps thirty
      all-steel cars&mdash;each fitted with two tiers of berths, eight to a
      side, sixteen to a car. Every berth is taken. One car is fitted up as an
      operating room, but fortunately no one is on the operating table as we
      crawl past. Another car is the private office of the surgeon in charge of
      the train. He is sitting at a big desk receiving reports form the
      orderlies. During the day we pass six of these splendidly appointed new
      all-steel hospital trains, all full of wounded. Some of them are able to
      sit up in their bunks and take a mild interest in us. Once, by a queer
      coincidence, we simultaneously pass the wounded going one way and
      cheering fresh troops going the other.</p>


      <h3>How the Belgians Fight</h3>

      <p class="h3">[By a Correspondent of The London Daily News.]</p>

      <p>LONDON, Oct. 28.&mdash;Writing from an unnamed place in Belgium a
      correspondent of The Daily News says:</p>

      <p>"The regiment I am concerned with was fifteen days and nights in the
      Antwerp trenches in countless engagements. It withdrew at dawn, hoping
      then to rest. It marched forty-five kilometers with shouldered rifles.
      In the next five days it marched nearly 200 kilometers until it reached
      the Nieuport and Dixmude line. By an error of judgment it got two days of
      drill and inspection in place of resting, then took its place in the
      front line on the Yser to face the most desperate of the German
      efforts."</p>

      <p>The correspondent quotes a young volunteer in this regiment as
      follows:</p>

      <p>"&mdash;&mdash; was evacuated by the Germans, and we were sent in at
      nightfall.  As soon as they saw our lights they began shelling us. We
      lost terribly.  A number of the men ran up the streets, but we got them
      together. I had about twenty and retired in order. We were 600 who went
      in, and must have left a third there.</p>

      <p>"In the morning we moved down to reinforce a network of trenches on
      our bank of the Yser. There was a farm on our right, and some of our men
      were firing at it, but the door opened and three officers in Belgian
      uniform came out shouting to us to cease fire, so we sent a detachment to
      the farm, and they were swept away by machine gun fire from the windows.
      No, I don't know what happened afterward about the farm. I lost sight of
      it.</p>

      <p>"We got into the trenches. They lay longways behind a raised
      artificial bank on our side of the river. At the northern end of them
      were mazes of cross trenches protecting them in case the Germans got
      across the bridge there and started to enfilade us. They were full of
      water. I was firing for six hours myself thigh deep in muddy water.</p>

      <p>"The Germans got across the bridge. We could not show head or hand
      over our bank. German machine guns shot us from crevices in their raised
      bank across the river only a few yards away. I was hours and hours
      dragging our wounded out of the cross trenches at the northern end of the
      bank southward and behind a mound till there was no more room for them
      there, and bringing up new men singly and two or three at a time from
      further down the trenches to take their places. We lost our officers, but
      I got the men to listen to me.</p>

      <p>"Some Germans shelled us with a cross fire. They got into the cross
      trenches. They fired down our lines from the side. We had to run back. I
      was too tired and sleepy to drag my feet. I think I must have fallen
      asleep.</p>

      <p>"We had an order to advance again. The French were behind us on either
      wing in support. I was too tired to get up. Some one kicked me. I looked
      up. They were three of my friends, volunteers like myself. We had all
      joined together. They apologized and ran forward. They are all wounded
      now, but we are all still alive, and I never have been hit once in
      thirty-four fights.</p>

      <p>"I got up. So did a man lying on the field in front of me. He was shot
      through the head and fell back on me. I got up again. A shell burst
      beside me and I saw three men, who were running past, just disappear. I
      was lying on my face again, and could not lift my head, either through
      fear or sleep, I don't know which.</p>

      <p>"I found myself running forward again. I called to men lying and
      running near and held my revolver at them. We were all charging with
      bayonets back at the Germans shooting us from our own trenches under the
      raised bank. They did not wait for us. They looked like frightened gray
      beetles as they scrambled up away over our bank and down into the river.
      It was dusk, but we shot at them over the bank. The water seemed full of
      them.  We crouched in a big trench in muddy water behind the bank. No, we
      did not sleep, but my head and eyes seemed to go to sleep from time to
      time.</p>

      <p>"There were perhaps 200 left of our 600. I think there was one officer
      further along, but it was quite dark. Some of the men talked very low.
      Then I heard voices whispering and talking near us on the river side of
      our bank. It was of earth perhaps five feet high and six feet thick. On
      the other side the slope fell steeply to the river.</p>

      <p>"I sent a hush along the line. We listened quite silent. I thought I
      heard German words, an order passed along on the other side. I crawled up
      on to the bank, not showing my head, you know. It was really about 300
      Germans who had stayed there on our side under the bank, fearing to cross
      the river under our fire. So we stayed all through the night. We did not
      sleep nor did they.</p>

      <p>"There was just six feet of piled wet earth between us. We only
      whispered and could hear them muttering and the sound of their belts
      creaking and of water bottles being opened.</p>

      <p>"There was a thick gray mist hanging low in the morning. I crawled on
      to the bank again, holding my revolver out-stretched. A gray figure stood
      up in the mist below close to me. He looked like a British soldier in
      khaki. He said: 'It's all right, we are English,' and I said, 'But your
      accent isn't,' and I shot him through with my revolver. Some of our men
      crept to the bank, but they shot them, and some of theirs climbed over,
      but we fired at their heads or arms as they showed only a few feet away,
      and they fell
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'bakward']">backward</ins>
      or on to us or lay hanging on the bank. Then we all waited.</p>

      <p>"As it grew lighter they did not dare move away, and none of us could
      get out alive or over the bank to use the bayonet. A few men made holes
      in the looser earth, and so we fired at each other through the bank here
      and there. Our guns could not help us, and theirs could not shoot across,
      for we were all together, and yet we could not get at each other. Some of
      the men&mdash;theirs and ours&mdash;got over lower down, so there was
      firing now and then, and two men were killed near me sliding down into
      the water in the trenches.</p>

      <p>"Somebody threw a cartridge case across close to me. On a paper inside
      was scrawled one word: 'Surrender!' We did not know if they wanted to
      surrender themselves or wanted us to surrender. They were more numerous,
      but we were better placed, so we went on scrapping and crawling around to
      get a shot at them.</p>

      <p>"Perhaps it was the French who got round at the ends. There was heavy
      firing. We heard quite close through the raised bank a few slipping down
      on the river edge and water splashing. Some of us pulled ourselves up on
      to the bank. I heard our men scrambling up on either side of me, but
      could not see them. I think I was too sleepy. I shouted to charge, and
      then must have fallen over on my head, rolling down the bank.</p>

      <p>"I am on the way down with these wounded. There are fifteen of us
      unhit here, but I think we came away just now with nearly a hundred out
      of our 600 of yesterday."</p>

      <p>He was doing gallant Captain's work, a young, slight, ordinary Belgian
      trooper, a volunteer private in the ranks, muddy, limping, and
      unspeakably tired in muscle and nerve. His story is as nearly as possible
      in his own words, interrupted by blanks in his own consciousness of
      events&mdash;lapses familiar to men whose muscles and nerves are exhausted,
      but who must still work on without sleep.</p>

      <p>For the following ten hours, without pause, he acted as interpreter
      and most capable adviser in getting long trains of stretchers with his
      wounded Belgian compatriots down and on to the British hospital
      ships.</p>


      <h3>A Visit to the Firing Line in France</h3>

      <p class="h3">[By a Correspondent of <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span>.]</p>

      <p>PARIS, Sept. 30.&mdash;In company with several representatives of
      American newspapers, I was permitted to pass several days in "the zone of
      military activity," on credentials obtained at the personal request of
      Ambassador Herrick, that we might describe the destruction caused by the
      Germans in unfortified towns. Although I have given a parole to say
      nothing concerning the movement of the troops or to mention certain
      points that I visited, I am now permitted to send a report of a part of
      my experiences.</p>

      <p>We crossed the entire battlefield of the Marne, passed directly behind
      the lines of the battle still raging on the Aisne, accidentally getting
      under fire for an entire afternoon, and lunching in a hotel to the
      orchestra of bursting shells, one end of the building being blown away
      during the bombardment. We witnessed a battle between an armored French
      monoplane and a German battery, and also had the experience of being
      accused of being German spies by two men wearing the English uniform,
      who, on failing to account for their own German accent, were speedily
      taken away under guard with their "numbers up," as the French Commandant
      expressed what awaited them.</p>

      <p>On account of our exceptional credentials we were able to see more
      actual war than many correspondents, who when they learned that permits
      to go to the front were not forthcoming, went anyway, usually falling
      into the hands of the military authorities before getting far. In fact,
      getting arrested has been the chief occupation of the war correspondents
      in this war, even our accidental view of the fighting being sufficient to
      cause our speedy return to Paris under parole.</p>

      <p>Going over the battlefield of the Marne, we found the battle had
      followed much the same tactics as a cyclone, in that in some places
      nothing, not even the haystacks, had been disturbed, while in others
      everything, the villages, roads, and fields, had been utterly devastated
      by shells. We talked with the inhabitants of every village and always
      heard the same story&mdash;that during occupation the Germans, evidently
      having been ordered to be on their good behavior after the Belgian
      atrocities, had offered little trouble to the civilians, and had confined
      their activities to looting and wasting the provisions. Also that when
      retreating they had destroyed all the food they were unable to carry.</p>

      <p>Our baptism of fire appropriately came while we were in a church. At
      noon of the second day we motored into a deserted village, and were
      stopped by a sentry who acknowledged our credentials, but warned us if we
      intended to proceed to beware of bullets. But there was not a hostile
      sound to alarm us.</p>

      <p>As we drove carelessly over the brow of a hill where the road dipped
      down a valley into the town, we were in direct line with the German fire,
      as great holes in the ground and fallen trees testified. It is a wonder
      our big motor car was not an immediate mark. On the way in we noticed a
      church steeple shot completely off, so after finding an inn, where the
      proprietor came from the cellar and offered to guard our car and prepare
      luncheon, we decided first to examine the church. The innkeeper explained
      that we had come during a lull in the bombardment, but the silent,
      deserted place lulled all sense of danger. The verger showed us over the
      church and we were walking through the ruined nave when suddenly we heard
      a sound like the shrill whistling of the wind.</p>

      <p>"It begins again," our conductor said simply. As the speech ended we
      heard a loud boom and the sound of falling masonry as a shell struck the
      far end of the building. We hurried to the hotel, the shells screaming
      overhead. We saw the buildings tumbling into ruins, glass falling in fine
      powder and remnants of furniture hanging grotesquely from scraps of
      masonry.</p>

      <p>All my life I had wondered what would be the sensation if I ever were
      under fire&mdash;would I be afraid? To my intense relief I suddenly became
      fatalistic. I was under fire with a vengeance, but instead of being
      afraid I kept saying to myself, "Being afraid won't help matters; besides
      nothing will happen if we just keep close to the walls and away from the
      middle street."</p>

      <p>On the way we met two men in English uniform who later denounced us as
      spies. We hailed them, and they replied that they had been cut off from
      their regiment and were now fighting with the French. Just as luncheon
      was announced eight soldiers filed into the hotel, arrested us, and
      marched us before the Commandant, who saw that our papers were all right,
      but suggested that on account of the dangerous position we leave as soon
      as possible. We asked permission to finish our luncheon. It was lucky
      that we were arrested then&mdash;before the accusation that we were
      spies&mdash;for when that question arose there was no doubt in the mind
      of the Commandant concerning us, so our accusers' charge merely reacted
      upon themselves.</p>

      <p>During the episode of arrest there was another lull in the
      bombardment, which began again as we were seated at luncheon. All through
      the meal the shells whistled and screamed overhead, and the dishes
      rattled constantly on the table.</p>

      <p>When the meal was over the proprietor called us to witness what had
      happened to the far wing of the hotel. It was completely demolished.
      "Alert" had just been sounded, and the soldiers were running through the
      streets. We ran out in time to see a building falling half a block away,
      completely filling the street by which we had entered the town an hour
      earlier.</p>

      <p>In a few minutes we heard the sharp crackle of infantry fire about
      half a mile away, and we had a sudden desire to get away before the
      automobile retreat was cut off. Just then we heard the sound of an aero
      engine overhead. It was flying so low that through a glass we could
      easily see the whirring propeller. The machine was mounted with a
      rapid-fire gun which was trying to locate the German gunners, who
      immediately abandoned the destruction of the town in an attempt to bring
      it down. For ten minutes we saw shells bursting all about it. At times it
      was lost in smoke, but when the smoke cleared there was the monoplane
      still blazing away, always mounting to a higher level, and finally
      disappearing toward the French lines.</p>

      <p>There was another lull in the cannonade, and we were permitted to pass
      down the street near the river, where, by peering around a building, we
      could see where the German batteries were secreted in the hills. We were
      warned not to get into the street which led to the bridge, as the Germans
      raked that street with their fire if a single person appeared.  We then
      took advantage of a lull in the firing and departed to the south at
      seventy miles an hour, in order to beat the shells, if any were aimed our
      way as we crossed the rise of the hill.</p>


      <h3>Unburied Dead Strew Lorraine</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Philip Gibbs of The London Daily Chronicle.</b></p>

      <p>DIJON, Sept. 26.&mdash;Although great interest is concentrated upon
      the northwest side of the line of of battle in France, it must not be
      forgotten that the east side is also of high importance.  The operation
      of the French and German forces along the jagged frontier from north to
      south is of vital influence upon the whole field of war, and any great
      movement of troops in this direction affects the strategy of the Generals
      to command on the furthermost wings.</p>

      <p>It was a desire to know something of what had been happening in the
      east which led me to travel to the extreme right. Few correspondents have
      been in this part of the field since the beginning of the war. It is far
      from their own line of communications. For this reason there have been no
      detailed narratives of the fighting in Lorraine, and a strange silence
      has brooded over those battlefields. The spell of it has been broken only
      by official bulletins telling in a line or two the uncertain result of
      the ceaseless struggle for mastery.</p>

      <p>Here are regiments of young men who have the right already to call
      themselves veterans, for they have been fighting continually for six
      weeks in innumerable engagements, for the most part unrecorded in
      official dispatches. I had seen them answering the call to mobilization,
      singing joyously as they marched through the streets. Then they were
      smart fellows, clean shaven and spruce in their new blue coats and
      scarlet trousers. Now war has put its dirt upon them and seems to have
      aged them by fifteen years, leaving its ineffaceable imprint upon their
      faces. Their blue coats have changed to a dusty gray, but they are hard
      and tough for the most part, and Napoleon himself would not have wished
      for better fighting men.</p>

      <p>Now for the first time since the beginning of the war there will be a
      little respite on the Lorraine frontier, and in the wooded country of the
      two lost provinces there will be time to bury the dead which incumber its
      fields. Words are utterly inadequate to describe the horrors of the
      region to the east of the Meurthe, in and around the little towns of
      Blamont, Badonviller, Cirey-les-Forges, Arracourt, Ch&acirc;teau-Salins,
      Morhauge, and Baudrecourt, where for six weeks there has been incessant
      fighting. After the heavy battle of Sept. 4, when the Germans were
      repulsed with severe losses after an attack in force, both sides retired
      for about twelve miles and dug themselves into lines of trenches which
      they still hold; but every day since that date there has been a kind of
      guerrilla warfare, with small bodies of men fighting from village to
      village and from wood to wood, the forces on each side being scattered
      over a wide area in advance of their main lines. This method of warfare
      is even more terrible than a pitched battle.</p>

      <p>"It is absurd to talk of Red Cross work," said one of the French
      soldiers who had just come out of the trenches at Lun&eacute;ville. "It
      has not existed as far as many of these fights are concerned How could
      it? A few litter-carriers came with us on some of our expeditions, but
      they were soon shot down, and after that the wounded just lay where they
      fell, or crawled away into the shelter of the woods. Those of us who were
      unhurt were not allowed to attend to our wounded comrades; it is against
      orders.  We have to go on regardless of losses. My own best comrade was
      struck down by my side. I heard his cry and saw him lying there with
      blood oozing through his coat. My heart wept to leave him. He wanted me
      to take his money, but I just kissed his hand and went on, I suppose he
      died, for I could not find him when we retreated."</p>

      <p>Another French soldier lay wounded at the edge of a wood ten miles
      from Lun&eacute;ville. When he recovered consciousness he saw there were
      only dead and dying men around him. He remained for two days, unable to
      move his shattered limbs, and cried out for death to relieve him of his
      agony.  At night he was numbed by cold; in the day thirst tortured him to
      the point of madness. Faint cries and groans came to his ears across the
      field. It was on the morning of the third day that French peasants came
      to rescue those who still remained alive.</p>

      <p>There have been several advances made by the French into Lorraine, and
      several retirements. On each occasion men have seen new horrors which
      have turned their stomachs. There are woods not far from Nancy from which
      there comes a pestilential stench which steals down the wind in gusts of
      obscene odor. For three weeks and more dead bodies of Germans and
      Frenchmen have lain rotting there. There are few grave diggers. The
      peasants have fled from their villages, and the soldiers have other work
      to do; so that the frontier fields on each side are littered with
      corruption, where plague and fever find holding ground.</p>

      <p>I have said that this warfare on the frontier is pitiless. This is a
      general statement of a truth to which there are exceptions. One of these
      was a reconciliation on the battlefield between French and German
      soldiers who lay wounded and abandoned near the little town of Blamont.
      When dawn came they conversed with each other while waiting for death. A
      French soldier gave his water bottle to a German officer who was crying
      out with thirst. The German sipped a little and then kissed the hand of
      the man who had been his enemy. "There will be no war on the other side,"
      he said.</p>

      <p>Another Frenchman, who came from Montmartre, found a Luxembourger
      lying within a yard of him whom he had known as a messenger in a big
      hotel in Paris. The young German wept to see his old acquaintance. "It is
      stupid," he said, "this war. You and I were happy when we were good
      friends in Paris. Why should we have been made to fight with each other?"
      He died with his arms around the neck of the soldier who told me the
      story, unashamed of his own tears.</p>

      <p>I could tell a score of tales like this, told to me by men whose eyes
      were still haunted by the sight of these things; and perhaps one day they
      will be worth telling, so that people of little imagination may realize
      the meaning of this war and put away false heroics from their lips. It is
      dirty business, with no romance in it for any of those fine young
      Frenchmen I have learned to love, who still stay in the trenches on the
      frontier lines or march a little way into Lorraine and back again.</p>

      <p>Some of those trenches on either side are still filled with men
      leaning forward with their rifles pointing to the enemy&mdash;quite dead,
      in spite of their lifelike posture.</p>


      <h3>Along the German Lines Near Metz</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Correspondence of The Associated Press.]</p>

      <p>WITH THE GERMAN ARMY BEFORE METZ, Sept. 30, (by Courier to Holland and
      Mail to New York.)&mdash;A five-day trip to the front has taken the
      correspondent of The Associated Press through the German fortresses of
      Mainz, Saarbr&uuml;cken, and Metz, through the frontier regions between
      Metz and the French fortress line from Verdun to Toul, into the actual
      battery positions from which German and Austrian heavy artillery were
      pounding their eight and twelve-inch shells into the French barrier forts
      and into the ranks of the French field army which has replaced the
      crumbling fortifications of steel and cement with ramparts of flesh and
      blood.</p>

      <p>Impressions at the end are those of some great industrial undertaking
      with powerful machinery in full operation and endless supply trains
      bringing up the raw materials for manufacture rather than of war as
      pictured.</p>

      <p>From a point of observation on a hillside above St. Mihiel the great
      battlefield on which a German army endeavoring to break through the line
      of barrier forts between Verdun and Toul and the opposing French forces
      could be surveyed in its entirety. In the foreground lay the level valley
      of the Meuse, with the towns of St. Mihiel and Banoncour nestling upon
      the green landscape. Beyond and behind the valley rose a tier of hills on
      which the French at this writing obstinately hold an intrenched position,
      checking the point of the German wedge, while the French forces from
      north and south beat upon the sides of the triangle, trying to force it
      back across the Meuse and out from the vitals of the French fortress
      line.</p>

      <p>Bursting shells threw up their columns of white or black fog around
      the edge of the panorama. Cloudlets of white smoke here and there showed
      where a position was being brought under shrapnel fire. An occasional
      aeroplane could be picked out hovering over the lines, but the infantry
      and the field battery positions could not be discerned even with a
      high-power field glass, so cleverly had the armies taken cover. The
      uninitiated observer would have believed this a deserted landscape rather
      than the scene of a great battle, which, if successful for the Germans,
      would force the main French Army to retreat from its intrenched positions
      along the Aisne River.</p>

      <p>About three miles away, across the Meuse, a quadrangular mound of
      black, plowed-up earth on the hillside marked the location of Fort Les
      Paroches, which had been silenced by the German mortars the night before.
      Fort Camp des Romains, so named because the Roman legions had centuries
      ago selected this site for a strategic encampment, had been stormed by
      Bavarian infantry two days earlier after its heavy guns had been put out
      of action, and artillery officers said that Fort Lionville, fifteen miles
      to the south and out of the range of vision, was then practically
      silenced, only one of its armored turrets continuing to answer the
      bombardment.</p>

      <p>The correspondent had spent the previous night at the fortress town of
      Metz, sleeping under the same roof with Prince Oscar of Prussia,
      invalided from the field in a state of physical breakdown; Prince William
      of Hohenzollern, father-in-law of ex-King Manuel, and other officers,
      either watching or engaged in the operations in the field, and had
      traveled by automobile to the battlefront thirty-five miles to the west.
      For the first part of the distance the road led through the hills on
      which are located the chain of forts comprising the fortress of Metz;
      but, although the General Staff officer in the car pointed now and then
      to a hill as the site of this or that fort, traces of the fortifications
      could only occasionally be made out. Usually they were so skillfully
      masked and concealed by woods or blended with the hillsides that nothing
      out of the ordinary was apparent, in striking contrast to the exposed
      position of the forts at the recently visited fortress of Li&eacute;ge,
      which advertised their presence from the sky line of the encompassing
      hills and fairly invited bombardment.</p>

      <p>The country as far as the frontier town of Gorze seemed bathed in
      absolute peace. No troops were seen, rarely were automobiles of the
      General Staff encountered, and men and women were working in the field
      and vineyards as if war were a thousand miles away instead of only next
      door.</p>

      <p>Beyond Gorze, however, the road leading southwest through Chambley and
      St. Beno&icirc;t Vigneuilles to St. Mihiel was crowded with long columns of
      wagons and automobile trucks bearing reserve ammunition, provisions, and
      supplies to the front, or returning empty for new loads to the unnamed
      railroad base in the rear. Strikingly good march discipline was observed,
      part of the road being always left free from the passage of staff
      automobiles or marching troops. Life seemed most comfortable for the
      drivers and escorts, as the army in advance had been so long in position,
      and its railroad base was so near, that supplying it involved none of the
      sleepless nights and days and almost superhuman exertions falling to the
      lot of the train in the flying march of the German armies toward
      Paris.</p>

      <p>A few miles beyond Gorze the French frontier was passed, and from this
      point on the countryside, with its deserted farms, rotting shocks of
      wheat, and uncut fields of grain, trampled down by infantry and scarred
      with trenches, excavations for batteries, and pits caused by exploding
      shells, showed war's devastating heel prints.</p>

      <p>Main army headquarters, the residence and working quarters of a
      commanding General whose name may not yet be mentioned, were in
      Ch&acirc;teau Chambley, a fine French country house. In the ch&acirc;teau
      the commanding General made all as comfortable as in his own home.
      Telegraph wires led to it from various directions, a small headquarters
      guard lounged on the grass under the trees, a dozen automobiles and motor
      cycles were at hand, and grooms were leading about the chargers of the
      General and his staff.  At St. Beno&icirc;t, five miles further on, a
      subordinate headquarters was encountered, again in a ch&acirc;teau
      belonging to a rich French resident.  The Continental soldier leaves
      tents to the American Army and quarters himself, whenever it is possible,
      comfortably in houses, wasting no energy in transporting and setting up
      tented cities for officers and men.  No matter how fast or how far a
      German army moves, a completely equipped telegraph office is ready for
      the army commander five minutes after headquarters have been
      established.</p>

      <p>At St. Beno&icirc;t a party of some 300 French prisoners was encountered,
      waiting outside headquarters. They were all fine young fellows, in
      striking contrast to the elderly reservist type which predominates in the
      German prison camps. They were evidently picked troops of the line, and
      were treated almost with deference by their guards, a detachment of
      bearded Landwehr men from South Germany. They were the survivors of the
      garrison of Fort Camp des Romains, who had put up such a desperate and
      spirited defense as to win the whole-hearted admiration and respect of
      the German officers and men. Their armored turrets and cemented bastions,
      although constructed after the best rules of fortification of a few years
      ago, had been battered about their ears in an unexpectedly short time by
      German and Austrian siege artillery. Their guns were silenced, and
      trenches were pushed up by an overwhelming force of pioneers and infantry
      to within five yards of their works before they retreated from the
      advanced intrenchments to the casemates of the fort.  Here they
      maintained a stout resistance, and refused every summons to surrender.
      Hand grenades were brought up, bound to a backing of boards, and exploded
      against the openings into the casemates, filling these with showers of
      steel splinters. Pioneers, creeping up to the dead angle of the
      casemates, where the fire of the defenders could not reach them, directed
      smoke tubes and stinkpots against apertures in the citadel, filling the
      rooms with suffocating smoke and gases.</p>

      <p>"Have you had enough?" the defenders were asked, after the first smoke
      treatment.</p>

      <p>"No!" was the defiant answer.</p>

      <p>The operation was repeated a second and third time, the response to
      the demand for surrender each time growing weaker, until finally the
      defenders were no longer able to raise their rifles, and the fort was
      taken. When the survivors of the plucky garrison were able to march out,
      revived by the fresh air, they found their late opponents presenting arms
      before them in recognition of their gallant stand. They were granted the
      most honorable terms of surrender, their officers were allowed to retain
      their swords, and on their march toward an honorable captivity they were
      everywhere greeted with expressions of respect and admiration.</p>

      <p>The headquarters guard here was composed of a company of infantry. The
      company's field kitchen, the soup-boiler and oven on wheels, which the
      German army copied from the Russians and which the soldiers facetiously
      and affectionately name their "goulash cannon," had that day, the Captain
      said, fed 970 men, soldiers of his own and passing companies,
      headquarters attach&eacute;s, wounded men and the detachment of French
      prisoners.</p>

      <p>Experienced German officers rank the field kitchens, with the sturdy
      legs of the infantry, the German heavy artillery and the aviation corps,
      as the most important factors in the showing made by the German
      armies.</p>

      <p>Beyond St. Beno&icirc;t the C&ocirc;te Lorraine, a range of wooded
      hills running north and south along the east bank of the Meuse, rises in
      steeply terraced slopes several hundred feet from the frontier plain,
      interposing a natural rampart between Germany and the French line of
      fortresses beyond the Meuse. The French had fortified these slopes with
      successive rows of trenches, permitting line above line of infantry to
      fire against an advancing enemy. For days a desperate struggle was waged
      for the possession of the heights, which was imperative for the German
      campaign against the line of fortresses.</p>

      <p>Germans do not mention the extent of their losses in any particular
      action, but it was admitted and evident that it had cost a high price to
      storm those steep slopes and win a position in the woods crowning the
      range from which their batteries could be directed against the French
      forts. Vigneuilles, a village at the foot of the hillside, shot into
      ruins by artillery and with every standing bit of house wall scarred with
      bullet marks from the hand-to-hand conflicts which had swayed to and fro
      in its streets, was typical of all the little stone-built towns serving
      as outposts to this natural fortress which had been the scene of
      imbittered attacks and counter-attacks before the German troops could
      fight their way up the hillsides.</p>

      <p>The combat is still raging on this day from north and south against
      the segment of this range captured by the Germans. The French, massing
      their troops by forest paths from Verdun and Toul, throw them against the
      Germans in desperate endeavors to break the lines which protect the sites
      for the German siege artillery, heavy mortars of 8-1/4 and 16-1/2 inch
      calibre and an intermediate sized type, and for the Austrian automobile
      batteries of 12-inch siege guns.</p>

      <p>The correspondent had no opportunity to inspect at close range the
      16-1/2-inch guns, the "growlers" of Li&eacute;ge, Namur, and other fortresses,
      which Krupp and the German Army uncovered as the surprise of this war.
      They could be heard even from Metz speaking at five-minute intervals. A
      battery of them, dug into the ground so that only the gun muzzles
      projected above the pits, was observed in action at a distance of about a
      half mile, the flash of flames being visible even at this distance.</p>

      <p>Their smaller sisters were less coy. A dismounted battery of the
      intermediate calibre, details of which are not available for publication,
      was encountered by the roadside, awaiting repairs to the heavy traction
      engine in whose train it travels in sections along the country roads,
      while the German 8-1/4-inch (21 centimeter) and the Austrian 12-inch
      (30.5 centimeter) batteries were seen in action.</p>

      <p>The heavy German battery lay snugly hidden in a wood on the rolling
      heights of the C&ocirc;te Lorraine. Better off than the French, whose aviators
      had for days repeatedly scrutinized every acre of land in the vicinity
      looking for these guns, we had fairly accurate directions how to find the
      battery, but even then it required some search and doubling back and
      forth before a languid artilleryman lounging by the roadside pointed with
      thumb over shoulder toward the hidden guns.</p>

      <p>These and the artillerymen were enjoying their midday rest, a pause
      which sets in every day with the regularity of the luncheon hour in a
      factory. The guns, two in this particular position, stood beneath a
      screen of thickly branching trees, the muzzles pointing toward round
      openings in this leafy roof. The gun carriages were screened with
      branches. The shelter tents of the men and the house for the ammunition
      had also been covered with green, and around the position a hedge of
      boughs kept off the prying eyes of possible French spies wandering
      through the woods.</p>

      <p>It was the noon pause, but the Lieutenant in charge of the guns,
      anxious to show them off to advantage, volunteered to telephone the
      battery commander, in his observation post four miles nearer the enemy,
      for permission to fire a shot or two against a village in which French
      troops were gathering for the attack. This battery had just finished with
      Les Paroches, a French barrier fort across the Meuse, and was now
      devoting its attention to such minor tasks. Only forts really counted,
      said the Lieutenant, recalling Fort Manonvillers, near Lun&eacute;ville, the
      strongest French barrier fort, which was the battery's first "bag" of the
      war. Its capture, thanks to his guns, had cost the German Army only three
      lives, those of three pioneers accidentally killed by the fire of their
      own men. Now Les Paroches was a heap of crumbled earth and stone.  In
      default of forts the guns were used against any "worthy target"&mdash;a
      "worthy target" being defined as a minimum of fifty infantrymen.</p>

      <p>At this moment the orderly reported that the battery commander
      authorized two shots against the village in question. At command the gun
      crew sprang to their posts about the mortar, which was already adjusted
      for its target, a little less than six miles away, the gun muzzle
      pointing skyward at an angle of about 60 degrees. As the gun was fired
      the projectile could be seen and followed in its course for several
      hundred feet. The report was not excessively loud.</p>

      <p>Before the report died away the crew were busy as bees about the gun.
      One man, with the hand elevating gear, rapidly cranked the barrel down to
      a level position, ready for loading. A second threw open the breech and
      extracted the brass cartridge case, carefully
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'wipping']">wiping</ins>
      it out before depositing it among the empties; four more seized the heavy
      shell and lifted it to a cradle opposite the breech; a seventh rammed it
      home; number eight gingerly inserted the brass cartridge, half filled
      with a vaseline-like explosive; the breech was closed, and the gun
      pointer rapidly cranked the gun again into position. In less than thirty
      seconds the men sprang back from the gun, again loaded and aimed. A short
      wait, and the observer from his post near the village ordered "next shot
      fifty meters nearer."</p>

      <p>The gun pointer made the slight correction necessary, the mortar again
      sent its shell purring through the air against the village, which this
      time, it was learned, broke into flames, and while the men went back to
      their noonday rest, the Lieutenant explained the fine points of his
      beloved guns. One man, as had been seen, could manipulate the elevation
      gear with one hand easily and quickly; ten of his horses could take the
      mortar, weighing eight tons, anywhere; it could fire up to 500 shots per
      day. He was proud of the skillful concealment of his guns, which had been
      firing for four days from the same position without being discovered,
      although French aviators had located all the sister batteries, all of
      which had suffered loss from shrapnel fire.</p>

      <p>Along the roadside through the C&ocirc;te Lorraine were here and there
      graves with rude crosses and penciled inscriptions. At the western edge
      of the forest the battle panorama of the Meuse Valley suddenly opened
      out, the hills falling away again steeply to the level valley below. The
      towns below&mdash;St. Mihiel and Banoncour&mdash;seemed absolutely deserted, not a
      person being visible even around the large barracks in the latter town.
      While the little party of officers and spectators, including the
      correspondent, were watching the artillery duel on the far horizon or
      endeavoring to pick out the infantry positions, a shrapnel suddenly burst
      directly before them, high in the air. There was a general stir, the
      assumption being that the French had taken the group on the hillside for
      a battery staff picking out positions for the guns; but as other shots
      were fired it was seen that the shrapnel was exploding regularly above
      the barracks, a mile and a half away, the French evidently suspecting the
      presence of German troops there.</p>

      <p>A ten-mile ride southward led to the position of the Austrian 12-inch
      battery. The two guns this time were planted by the side of the road,
      screened only in front by a little wood, but exposed to view from both
      sides, the rear, and above. For this greater exposure the battery had
      paid correspondingly, several of its men having been killed or wounded by
      hostile fire. Here, as in the German batteries, the war work in progress
      went on with a machinelike regularity and absence of spectacular features
      more characteristic of a rolling mill than a battle. The men at the guns
      went through their work with the deftness and absence of confusion of
      high-class mechanics. The heavy shells were rolled to the guns, hoisted
      by a chain winch to the breech opening, and discharged in uninteresting
      succession, a short pause coming after each shot, until the telephonic
      report from the observation stand was received. The battery had been
      firing all day at Fort Lionville, at a range of 9,400 meters, (nearly six
      miles,) and the battery commander was then endeavoring to put out of
      action the only gun turret which still answered the fire. The task of
      finding this comparatively minute target, forty or fifty feet in
      diameter, was being followed with an accuracy which promised eventual
      success.</p>

      <p>The shells from the guns started on their course with characteristic
      minute-long shrieks. Watches were pulled out to determine just how long
      the shrieks could be heard, and the uninitiated were preparing to hear
      the sound of the explosion itself. The battery chief explained, however,
      that this scream was due to the conditions immediately around the muzzle
      of the gun, and could not be heard from other points. He invited close
      watch of the atmosphere a hundred yards before the gun at the next shot.
      Not only could the projectile be seen plainly in the beginning of its
      flight, but the waves of billowing air, rushing back to fill the void
      left by the discharge and bounding and rebounding in a tempestuous sea of
      gas, could be distinctly observed. This airy commotion caused the sound
      heard for more than a minute.</p>


      <h3>The Slaughter in Alsace</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By John H. Cox of The London Standard.</b></p>

      <p>BASLE, Switzerland, Aug. 19.&mdash;I have just returned
      from an inspection of the scenes of the recent fighting between the
      French and Germans in the southern districts of Alsace.</p>

      <p>Dispatches from Paris and Berlin describe the engagements between the
      frontier and M&uuml;lhausen as insignificant encounters between advance
      guards. If this be true in a military sense, and the preliminaries of the
      war produce the terrible effects I have witnessed, the disastrous results
      of the war itself will exceed human comprehension.</p>

      <p>As a Swiss subject I was equipped with identification papers and
      accompanied by four of my countrymen, all on bicycles.</p>

      <p>At the very outset the sight of peasants, men and women, unconcernedly
      at work in the fields gathering the harvest, struck me as strange and
      unnatural. The men were either old or well advanced in middle age.
      Everywhere women, girls, and mere lads were working.</p>

      <p>The first sign of war was the demolished villa of a Catholic priest at
      a village near Ransbach. This priest had lived there for many years,
      engaged in religious work and literary pursuits. After the outbreak of
      the war the German authorities jumped at the conclusion that he was an
      agent of the French Secret Service and that he had been in the habit of
      sending to Belfort information concerning German military movements and
      German measures for defense&mdash;very often by means of carrier pigeons.</p>

      <p>The Alsatians say that these accusations were utterly unjust; but last
      week a military party raided the priest's house, dragged him from his
      study, placed him against his own garden wall and shot him summarily as a
      traitor and spy. The house was searched from top to bottom, and numerous
      books and papers were removed, after which the building was destroyed by
      dynamite. The priest was buried without a coffin at the end of his little
      garden plot, and some of the villagers placed a rough cross on the mound
      which marked the place of interment.</p>

      <p>In the next large village we were told that it had been successively
      occupied by French and German troops and had been the scene of stiff
      infantry fighting.</p>

      <p>Here we found groups of old men and boys burying dead men and horses,
      whose bodies were already beginning to be a menace to health. The weather
      here has been exceptionally hot, and the countryside is bathed in blazing
      sunshine. Further on were a number of German soldiers beating about in
      the standing crops on both sides of the road, searching for dead and
      wounded. They said many of the wounded had crawled in among the wheat to
      escape being trodden upon by the troops marching along the road, and also
      to gain relief from the heat.</p>

      <p>On the outskirts of another large village we saw a garden bounded by a
      thick hedge, behind which a company of French infantry had taken their
      stand against the advancing German troops. Among the crushed flowers
      there were still lying fragments of French soldiers' equipments, two
      French caps stained with blood and three torn French tunics,
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'liewise']">likewise</ins>
      dyed red. The walls of the cottage bore marks of rifle bullets, and the
      roof was partially burned.</p>

      <p>Passing through the villages we saw on all sides terrible signs of the
      devastation of war&mdash;houses burned, uncut grain trodden down and rendered
      useless, gardens trampled under foot; everywhere ruin and distress.</p>

      <p>At a small village locally known as Napoleon's Island we found the
      railway station demolished and the line of trucks the French had used as
      a barricade. These trucks had been almost shot to pieces, and many were
      stained with blood. Outside the station the small restaurant roof had
      been shot away; the windows were smashed, and much furniture had been
      destroyed. Nevertheless the proprietor had rearranged his damaged
      premises as well as possible and was serving customers as if nothing had
      happened.</p>

      <p>Just outside this village there are large common graves in which
      French and German soldiers lie buried together in their uniforms. Large
      mounds mark these sites. Here again the villagers have placed roughly
      hewn crosses.</p>

      <p>Not far from Huningen we met an intelligent Alsatian peasant who
      remembered the war of 1870 and had witnessed some engagements in the last
      few days. Here is his account of what he saw:</p>

      <p>"The bravery on both sides was amazing. The effects of artillery fire
      are terrific. The shells burst, and where you formerly saw a body of
      soldiers you see a heap of corpses or a number of figures writhing on the
      ground, torn and mutilated by the fragments of the shell. Those who are
      unhurt scatter for the moment, but quickly regain their composure and
      take up their positions in the fighting line as if nothing had happened.
      The effects of other weapons are as bad. It seems remarkable that
      soldiers can see the destruction worked all around them, yet can control
      their nerves sufficiently to continue fighting.</p>

      <p>"I remember the battles of 1870, in five or six of which I fought
      myself, but they bear no comparison with the battles of 1914. War
      forty-four years ago was child's play compared with war at the present
      time."</p>

      <p>In several villages the schools and churches and many cottages are
      filled with wounded Frenchmen and Germans, and everything is being done
      to relieve their sufferings. In the stress of fighting many wounded
      soldiers were left from three to ten or twelve hours lying in the fields
      or on the roads. The ambulance equipment of modern armies appears utterly
      inadequate, and most of the wounded were picked up by villagers.</p>

      <p>A French aeroplane from Belfort reconnoitred the German positions
      behind M&uuml;lhausen. As it passed over the German works at the Isteiner
      Klotz there ensued a continuous firing of machine guns and rifles. The
      aeroplane, which had swerved downward to give its two occupants a closer
      and clearer view of the German position, immediately rose to a much
      greater altitude and escaped injury. It cruised over the German position
      for more than an hour, now rising, now falling, always pursued by the

      part of which was carried out at an altitude as low as 1,000 feet, was

      <p>BERNE, Aug. 22, (Dispatch to The London Morning
      Post.)&mdash;Gebweiler, in Alsace, twelve miles to the northwest of M&uuml;lhausen,
      was taken by the French at the point of the bayonet on Aug. 20. My
      correspondent, who has just arrived at Basle from the field of battle,
      says that eight battalions of the German One Hundred and Fourteenth
      Regiment, numbering about 10,000 men, engaged the French Army. The French
      artillery was deadly and caused great ravages among the Germans, few
      officers escaping.</p>

      <p>During the whole night the wounded were being transported to villages
      in the neighborhood, beyond the reach of artillery. All the buildings of
      Sierenz were filled with wounded.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of horses were stretched on the field of battle. Those of the
      German artillery were killed, and in consequence the German forces left
      their artillery, of which about twenty guns are now in the hands of the
      French.</p>

      <p>The object of the German troops was to cut off the retreat of the
      French and force them toward the Swiss frontier&mdash;an object which they
      failed to achieve.</p>

      <p>The wounded received here say that they passed a terrible night in the
      open, without water or other succor, with the pitiful neighing of wounded
      horses ringing in their ears.</p>


      <h3>Rennenkampf on the Prussian Border</h3>

      <p class="h3">[By a Correspondent of The London Daily Chronicle.]</p>

      <p>GRADNO, (via Petrograd,) Oct. 21.&mdash;I have returned
      here after a journey along the East Prussian frontier, as close to the
      scenes of daily fighting as I could obtain permission to go. The route
      was from the north of Suwalki southward to Graevo, a stretch of country
      recently in German occupation, but where now remains not a single German
      outpost.</p>

      <p>It is stimulating to see the Russian soldier in his habits as he lives
      and fights. I have seen many thousands of them camped in the rain,
      swamped in bogs, or marching indefatigably over the roads which are long
      quagmires of mud, always with an air of stolid contentment and the look
      of being bent on business. They include Baltic Province men speaking
      German. Jews from Riga and Libau are brigaded with huge Siberians, whose
      marching must constitute a world record. The Cossacks are past counting,
      and with them are long-coated, tight-belted Circassians and Kalmucks, all
      representing a mixture of races and languages like that of the British
      Empire itself.</p>

      <p>Actually the whole line is a battle front from north of Wirballen to
      well into Poland, and no day passes without contact with the Germans.
      This is an army in which every man has fought. Most of them have been in
      hand-to-hand conflict with the Germans. They have approached the front
      through a country which the enemy has devastated. There is no village
      which does not bear the mark of wanton destruction. I have seen these
      things for myself. Houses have been burned, others pillaged and the
      contents dragged into the streets and there smashed. Churches have been
      invariably gutted and defiled.</p>

      <p>It is impossible not to admire these endless battalions of Siberians.
      They are common objects of this countryside. I came past Suwalki as they
      were moving up, column after column, in gray overcoats aswing in the
      rhythm of their stride, like the kilts of Highlanders. It was they who
      bore the brunt of the fighting, unsupported by artillery, in forests of
      Augustowo, and, with the Baltic regiments, pushed on and took Lyck.
      These are the men who marched forty miles, starting at midnight, then
      went into action between Gor and Raigrod and delivered a bayonet charge
      which their officers still boast about today.</p>

      <p>I may not indicate the geography of the front on which the Russians
      and Germans are now facing each other, but the German general plan is to
      protect the railway and all approaches to a vital junction such as
      Goldapp and Insterburg. Between them and the frontier lies a country of
      singular difficulty for the troops. It is easy of defense, with small
      broken hills, innumerable lakes and roads winding in watered valleys
      among woods. The Germans have gone to earth in their usual lavish
      fashion, digging themselves in with a thoroughness worthy of permanent
      fortifications. Their trenches are five feet deep, with earthworks in
      front zig-zagging as a precaution against enfilading. Some of them are
      very cleverly hidden with growing bushes. All peasants remaining at the
      country-side in Prussia are compelled to work digging trenches. The
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'implacements']">emplacements</ins>
      for guns of large calibre have concrete foundations.</p>

      <p>The Germans had fortified Suwalki, employing forced labor. They had
      connected up the trench system with telephone installation and appointed
      a Military Governor and other functionaries. Many German officers were
      joined there by their wives and families, who when they retired took with
      them souvenirs consisting of nearly every portable object of value in the
      town, besides much furniture and clothing.</p>

      <p>The Russian trenches are scarcely more than shallow grooves in the
      ground with earth thrown up in front of them, making barely sufficient
      cover for prone riflemen.</p>

      <p>At once the German outer positions were carried by storm with ghastly
      carnage.</p>

      <p>"We didn't dig much," said a Russian officer to me. "We knew we
      shouldn't stay there. We should either go forward or back, and we were
      sure to go forward."</p>

      <p>The cloud of patrols, mostly Cossacks, which flits unceasingly along
      the German front is the subject of innumerable stories.</p>

      <p>When the news was issued that the Kaiser had come east to take command
      of his army on this front a Cossack came in, driving before him a plump,
      distressed Prussian Captain whom he had gleaned during the day's
      work.</p>

      <p>"I've brought him," he announced. "I knew him by his mustache," and he
      produced an old picture postcard from his breast showing the Kaiser with
      his characteristic mustache.</p>

      <p>Near Augustowo the roads are literally blocked in many places with
      abandoned German transports which became trapped in the terribly muddy
      country. Dead horses in hundreds lie everywhere and the Russian Sanitary
      Corps is busy burying them. Yet the Russians who are still moving about
      this country retain not only their usual average health, but do not even
      complain.</p>

      <p>Between Augustowo and Raigrod a small stream is actually blocked with
      German stores, including much gun ammunition. The German advance which
      ended in this debacle has been the costliest defeat in point of materials
      which they have yet suffered.</p>


      <h3>The First Fight at Lodz</h3>

      <p class="h3"><b>By Percival Gibbon of The London Daily Chronicle.</b></p>

      <p>WARSAW, Dec. 5, (by Courier to Petrograd.)&mdash;I have
      wired you previously of the German force which advanced around Lodz and
      was cut off south and east of the town. This consisted of two army
      corps&mdash;the Twenty-fifth Corps and the Third Guard Corps. The isolated
      force turned north and endeavored to cut its way out through the small
      town of Breziziny. It was at Breziziny that final disaster overtook
      them.</p>

      <p>The town and road lie in a hollow in the midst of wooded country,
      where the Germans were squeezed from the Vistula and pressed to the rear.
      They had fought a battle during the slow retirement of five days and were
      showing signs of being short of ammunition. On the fifth day they made
      their final attempt to pass through Breziziny. That was where that fine
      strategist and fighting man who held Ivangorod on the Vistula brought off
      the great dramatic coup for which he had been manoeuvring.</p>

      <p>The Germans were holding the town and pouring through when he began
      his general attack. Breziziny underwent nine hours of furious shelling
      and only half the town is now remaining. The Russian infantry again
      proved its sterling quality, and, supported by the tremendous fire of its
      own guns, drove home charge after charge, smashing the German resistance
      completely. By nightfall out of two army corps, numbering 80,000 men,
      there remained only a remnant.</p>

      <p>The number of prisoners reaches the total of about 20,000, and of the
      remainder fully 80 per cent, were killed or wounded. This is the estimate
      supplied to me. Owing to the small area on which the fighting was
      concentrated, the dead are lying in great mounds and walls at points
      where the charges were pushed home. For miles the countryside is dotted
      with dead.</p>

      <p>In the sparser grounds an unknown number of fugitives, most of whom
      are wounded, are lurking in the woods. From Rawa, south of Skierniwice,
      midway between Lodz and Warsaw, to Lodz on the line of the former German
      retreat and present advance, not a single village remains. All the
      burned-out district is utterly desolate.</p>

      <p>On Dec. 1, 2, and 3 the force conducting the defense of the town of
      Lodz was all but surrounded. The German positions were at Royicie on the
      southern road, within four miles of the long, straggling street which
      comprises most of the town of Lodz, while at Zgierz, seven miles to the
      north, they had a battery of heavy guns with which they shelled the town
      itself, killing several hundred civilians. The fire was chiefly directed
      on the railway and station and the Russian guns were unable for some time
      to locate the battery. It was discovered and reconnoitred at last by an
      aeroplane.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Then followed an act of heroism and harebrained enterprise which is
      now the talk of the whole army. On Thursday night last the Colonel of
      Artillery made his way out and with a little group of assistants
      contrived to drag a field telephone wire within half a mile of the German
      battery. While a searchlight was swinging over the face of the country,
      he lay on the ground, and from there directed the Russian guns, which
      with his help actually succeeded in silencing the battery. The Russian
      guns were at this time placed in the streets of Lodz.</p>

      <p>On Thursday night, when the attack culminated, there were 700 guns in
      action at one time on both sides, and throughout the night all was alight
      with flashes from the guns and bursting shells, and the thunder of the
      guns was faintly audible on the outskirts of Warsaw, sixty miles
      away.</p>

      <p>Then there followed a general assault of the Germans, a charge of huge
      masses of men, who followed up into the glare of the searchlights under
      an inferno of gunfire. Here again the Siberians demonstrated the
      qualities which have made them famous throughout the war. They met the
      Germans with a rifle fire from the trenches which not only stopped them
      but shattered them. They again played the old trick of allowing the enemy
      to approach within fifty feet, meanwhile holding their fire, and then
      blowing them off their feet with rifle fire and their use of the
      mitrailleuse.</p>

      <p>The attack failed utterly, and from the very manner of it the Russian
      losses could not be otherwise than light, while the German losses in the
      whole of the operations against Lodz and the neighboring positions exceed
      a hundred thousand killed. No guess at the number of their wounded can be
      attempted, but we know that score upon score of trains filled with them
      have gone west along the Kalisz line, and still continue to go.</p>


      <h3>The First Invasion of Servia</h3>

      <p class="h3">[By a Correspondent of The London Standard.]</p>

      <p>NISH, Servia, Aug. 31.&mdash;After the butcheries and atrocities which
      I witnessed during preceding battles I thought I would get accustomed and
      insensible to these scenes of blood, but from my last visit to the
      slaughter house I have brought such visions of horror that their very
      thought makes me shudder. The object of the Austrian Army seems to have
      been complete devastation.</p>

      <p>The fierce battle which the Servians gave them incessantly for more
      than a week may be divided into two conflicts of equal intensity which
      raged along the ridge of the heights of Tser. Each of the two slopes,
      descending one to the Save and the town of Shabatz and the other to the
      Drina, is now nothing but a charnel house.</p>

      <p>I could not say which of these two conflicts was more murderous, but
      this admirably fertile region, with its countless fruit trees, is now
      sheltering the last remains of hundreds of butchered men, women, and
      children.</p>

      <p>When after three days and three nights of truceless fighting the
      Servians succeeded in surprising the enemy in the middle of the night at
      Tser, the toll of dead was so colossal that the Servian troops were
      constrained for the time being to abandon burying the corpses.</p>

      <p>Everywhere the fighting was of the fiercest conceivable nature, for to
      resist the invaders was to the Servians a question of life and death. At
      several points they fought right up to the last man, succumbing but never
      falling back.</p>

      <p>The volunteer corps of Capt. Tankositch, the famous leader whose head
      Austria is so anxious to gain, was charged to defend Kroupage, situated
      south of the battle front, between Losnitza and Lionbovia. Considerable
      Austrian forces attempted to advance with the view of driving the Captain
      back.</p>

      <p>For two days and three nights Tankositch and 236 volunteers held their
      position. At last three whole Austrian regiments surrounded them, but
      rather than yield to the enemy Tankositch and his gallant miniature army
      resolved to fight to the last. In the dead of night he sent out a small
      group to meet the Austrians. This group, consisting of a mere handful of
      soldiers, hurled a shower of bombs at the enemy, cutting up his ranks,
      and secured a free pass.</p>

      <div class="ctr">
         <a href="images/image029-full.jpg">
            <img src="images/image029.jpg"
            alt="The Battlefield in Servia."
            title="The Battlefield in Servia."/>
         </a>
         <p class="caption"><b>The Battlefield in Servia.</b></p>
      </div>

      <p>At the first break of day, when Tankositch counted his men, only
      forty-six answered the call. They surrounded more than a hundred
      prisoners.</p>

      <p>It will be realized that in the course of such sharp fighting the
      Servian losses must have been considerable, although they were much
      smaller than those of the enemy.</p>

      <p>The most pitiful and heartrending aspect of these scenes was presented
      by the long procession of Servian survivors from the neighboring
      villages, consisting of old men, women, and children, bringing in the
      heavy toll of mutilated human beings. At Valievo, the nearest town to the
      field of battle, large masses of Servian and Austrian wounded kept
      pouring in incessantly. About 10,000 have already arrived. All had to be
      examined, all had to have their wounds dressed, and at Valievo there are
      only six doctors.</p>

      <p>In spite of this appalling shortage of medical aid, I witnessed
      yesterday a most touching spectacle. A car drawn by oxen brought to the
      hospital at Valievo its load of mutilated soldiers. In the first portion
      of the car were three wounded Austrians and in the second two wounded
      Servians and two more Austrians. The convoys wanted to carry the Austrian
      wounded to the dressing room before their own wounded. A Servian doctor
      stopped them.</p>

      <p>"Bring the wounded in in the order in which they come," he commanded,
      and, without any regard for the nationality of his patients, the doctor
      and his colleagues commenced their humanitarian work.</p>

      <p>What are the Red Crosses of the neutral countries waiting for? Why do
      they not come here? In the name of gallant little Servia, in the name of
      a humane and pitiful people, I make urgent appeal to the Red Crosses to
      send a portion of their staff here. There are thousands of lives to be
      saved.</p>

      <p>Now I must begin a chapter of sorrows. I wanted to witness the
      Austro-Hungarian excesses a second time before speaking of them, so that
      I could give an exact and genuine account of actual facts. Courage failed
      me to see all, but what I have seen can be summed up in one phrase. In
      the environs of Shabatz the vanquished put the finishing touch to their
      acts of fearful savagery by butchering their Servian prisoners, whose
      corpses were found heaped up in the town.</p>

      <p>Yesterday and the day before I ran across country through Valievo
      toward Drina. Further north, barely forty miles from Valievo, at
      Seablatcha, the poor refugees who had fled from their houses before the
      onslaught of the Austrians showed me eight young people, tied one to
      another, who were all pierced by bayonets.</p>

      <p>Five miles from there, at Bella Tserka, fugitives of the village with
      indescribable despair were burying the mutilated, bodies of fourteen
      little girls. Six peasants were found hanging in an orchard.</p>

      <p>At Lychnitsa, on the Drina, about a hundred old men, inoffensive
      civilians, were massacred before the eyes of their wives and children.
      All the women and children were led over on the other side of the bank of
      the Drina in order to compel the Servians to stop their fire.</p>

      <p>It is not war that Austria-Hungary tried to make on Servia. That great
      nation wanted to exterminate the Servian people. She thought she would
      succeed before Servia had time to defend herself.</p>

      <p>Austrian prisoners affirm that they received orders to hang all those
      striving against their country, to burn all the enemy's villages, and put
      all their inhabitants to death.</p>

      <p>The Servian Quartermaster General is drawing up an official list of
      these Austro-Hungarian deeds.</p>


      <h3>The Attack on Tsing-tau</h3>

      <p class="h3"><b>By Jefferson Jones of The Minneapolis Journal and The
         Japan Advertiser.</b></p>

      <p>JAPANESE HEADQUARTERS, Shantung, Nov. 2.&mdash;I have seen
      war from a grand stand seat. I never before heard of the possibility of
      witnessing a modern battle&mdash;the attack of warships, the fire of infantry
      and artillery, the manoeuvring of airships over the enemy's lines, the
      rolling up from the rear of reinforcements and supplies&mdash;all at one sweep
      of the eye; yet, after
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'watchnig']">watching</ins>
      for three days the siege of Tsing-tau from a position on Prinz Heinrich
      Berg, 1,000 feet above the sea level and but three miles from the
      beleaguered city, I am sure that there is actually such a thing as a
      theatre of war.</p>

      <p>On Oct. 31, the date of the anniversary of the birth of the Emperor of
      Japan, the actual bombardment of Tsing-tau began. All the residents of
      the little Chinese village of Tschang-tsun, where was fixed on that day
      the acting staff headquarters of the Japanese troops, had been awakened
      early in the morning by the roar of a German aeroplane over the village.
      Every one quickly dressed and, after a hasty breakfast, went out to the
      southern edge of the village to gaze toward Tsing-tau.</p>

      <p>A great black column of smoke was arising from the city and hung like
      a pall over the besieged. At first glance it seemed that one of the
      neighboring hills had turned into an active volcano and was emitting this
      column of smoke, but it was soon learned that the oil tanks in Tsing-tau
      were on fire.</p>

      <p>As the bombardment was scheduled to start late in the morning, we were
      invited to accompany members of the staff of the Japanese and British
      expeditionary forces on a trip to Prinz Heinrich Berg, there to watch the
      investment of the city. It was about a three-mile journey to this
      mountain, which had been the scene of some severe fighting between the
      German and Japanese troops earlier in the month.</p>

      <p>When we arrived at the summit there was the theatre of war laid out
      before us like a map. To the left were the Japanese and British cruisers
      in the Yellow Sea, preparing for the bombardment. Below was the Japanese
      battery, stationed near the Meeker House, which the Germans had burned in
      their retreat from the mountains. Directly ahead was the City of
      Tsing-tau, with the Austrian cruiser Kaiserin Elisabeth steaming about in
      the harbor, while to the right one could see the Kiao-Chau coast and
      central forts and redoubts and the intrenched Japanese and British
      camps.</p>

      <p>We had just couched ourselves comfortably between some large, jagged
      rocks, where we felt sure we were not in a direct line with the enemy's
      guns, when suddenly there was a flash as if some one had turned a large
      golden mirror in the field down beyond to the right. A little column of
      black smoke drifted away from one of the Japanese trenches, and a minute
      later those of us on the peak of Prinz Heinrich heard the sharp report of
      a field gun.</p>

      <p>"Gentlemen, the show has started," said the British Captain, as he
      removed his cap and started adjusting his "opera glass." No sooner had he
      said this than the reports of guns came from all directions with a
      continuous rumble as if a giant bowling alley were in use. Everywhere the
      valley at the rear of Tsing-tau was alive with golden flashes from
      discharging guns, and at the same time great clouds of bluish-white smoke
      would suddenly spring up around the German batteries where some Japanese
      shell had burst. Over near the greater harbor of Tsing-tau we could see
      flames licking up the Standard Oil Company's large tanks. We afterward
      learned that these had been set on fire by the Germans and not by a
      bursting shell.</p>

      <p>And then the warships in the Yellow Sea opened fire on Iltis Fort, and
      for three hours we continually played our glasses on the field&mdash;on
      Tsing-tau and on the warships. With glasses on the central redoubt of the
      Germans we watched the effects of the Japanese fire until the boom of
      guns from the German Fort A, on a little peninsula jutting out from
      Kiao-Chau Bay, toward the east, attracted our attention there. We could
      see the big siege gun on this fort rise up over the bunker, aim at a
      warship, fire, and then quickly go down again. And then we would turn our
      eyes toward the warships in time to see a fountain of water 200 yards
      from a vessel, where the shell had struck. We scanned the city of
      Tsing-tau. The 150-ton crane in the greater harbor, which we had seen
      earlier in the day, and which was said to be the largest crane in the
      world, had disappeared and only its base remained standing. A Japanese
      shell had carried away the crane.</p>

      <p>But this first day's firing of the Japanese investing troops was
      mainly to test the range of the different batteries. The attempt also was
      made to silence the line of forts extending in the east from Iltis Hill,
      near the wireless and signal stations at the rear of Tsing-tau, to the
      coast fort near the burning oil tank on the west. In this they were
      partly successful, two guns at Iltis Fort being silenced by the guns at
      sea.</p>

      <p>On Nov. 1, the second day of the bombardment, we again stationed
      ourselves on the peak of Prinz Heinrich Berg. From the earliest hours of
      morning the Japanese and British forces had kept up a continuous fire on
      the German redoubts in front of the Iltis, Moltke, and Bismarck forts,
      and when we arrived at our seats it seemed as though the shells were
      dropping around the German trenches every minute. Particularly on the
      redoubt of Taitung-Chen was the Japanese fire heavy, and by early
      afternoon, through field glasses, this German redoubt appeared to have
      had an attack of smallpox, so pitted was it from the holes made by
      bursting Japanese shells. By nightfall many parts of the German redoubts
      had been destroyed, together with some machine guns. The result was the
      advancing of the Japanese lines several hundred yards from the bottom of
      the hills where they had rested earlier in the day.</p>

      <p>It was not until the third day of the bombardment that those of us
      stationed on Prinz Heinrich observed that our theatre of war had a
      curtain, a real asbestos one that screened the fire in the drops directly
      ahead of us from our eyes. We had learned that the theatre was equipped
      with pits, drops, a gallery for onlookers, exits, and an orchestra of
      booming cannon and rippling, roaring pompons; but that nature had
      provided it with a curtain&mdash;that was something new to us.</p>

      <p>We had reached the summit of the mountain about 11 A.M., just as some
      heavy clouds, evidently disturbed by the bombardment during the previous
      night, were dropping down into Litsun Valley and in front of Tsing-tau.
      For three hours we sat on the peak shivering in a blast from the sea, and
      all the while wondering just what was being enacted beyond the curtain.
      The firing had suddenly ceased, and with the filmy haze before our eyes
      we conjured up pictures of the Japanese troops making the general attack
      upon Iltis Fort, evidently the key to Tsing-tau, while the curtain, of
      the theatre of war was down.</p>

      <p>By early afternoon the clouds lifted, and with glasses we were able to
      distinguish fresh sappings of the Japanese infantry nearer to the German
      redoubts. The Japanese guns, which the day before were stationed below us
      to the left, near the Meeker House, had advanced half a mile and were on
      the road just outside the village of Ta-Yau. Turning our glasses on
      Kiao-Chau Bay, we discovered that the Kaiserin Elisabeth was missing, nor
      did a search of the shore line reveal her. Whether she was blown up by
      the Germans or had hidden behind one of the islands I do not know.</p>

      <p>All the guns were silent now, and the British Captain said: "Well,
      chaps, shall we take advantage of the intermission?"</p>

      <p>A half-hour later we were down the mountain and riding homeward toward
      Tschang-Tsun.</p>

      <p>To understand fully the operations of the Japanese troops in Shantung
      during the present Far Eastern war one must be acquainted with the
      topography of this peninsula, as well as with the conditions that exist
      for the successful movements of the troops.</p>

      <p>Since the disembarkation of the Japanese Army on Sept. 2 everything
      has seemingly favored the Germans. The country, which is unusually
      mountainous, offering natural strongholds for resisting the invading
      army, is practically devoid of roads in the hinterland. To add to this
      difficulty, the last two months in Shantung have seen heavy rains and
      floods which have really aided in holding off the ultimate fall of
      Kiao-Chau.</p>

      <p>One had only to see the road from Lanschan over Makung Pass, on which
      the Japanese troops were forced to rely for their supplies, partly to
      understand the reason for the German garrison at Tsing-tau still holding
      out. The road, especially near the base, is nothing but a sea of clay in
      which the military carts sink up to their hubs. Frequent rains every week
      keep the roadway softened up and thus render it necessary for the
      Japanese infantry to rebuild it and to construct drainage ditches in
      order that there may be no delay in getting supplies and ammunition to
      the troops at the front.</p>

      <p>The physical characteristics of Kiao-Chau make it an ideal fortress.
      The entrance of the bay is nearly two miles wide and is commanded by
      hills rising 600 feet directly in the rear of Tsing-tau. The ring of
      hills that surrounds the city does not extend back into the hinterland,
      and thus there is no screen behind which the Japanese forces can quickly
      invest the city. Germany has utilized the semicircle of hills in the
      construction of large concrete forts equipped with Krupp guns of 14 and
      16 inch calibre, which, for four or five miles back into the peninsula,
      command all approaches to the city.</p>

      <p>The Japanese Army in approaching Tsing-tau has had to do so
      practically in the open. The troops found no hills behind which they
      could with safety mount heavy siege guns without detection by the German
      garrison.  In fact, the strategic plan for the capture of the town has
      been much like the plan adopted by the Japanese forces at Port
      Arthur&mdash;they have forced their approach by sappings. While this is a
      gradual method, it is certain of victory in the end and results in very
      little loss of life.</p>

      <p>The natural elevations of the Iltis, Bismarck, and Moltke forts at the
      rear of Tsing-tau have another advantage in that they are so situated
      that they are commanded by at least two other forts. All of the guns had
      been so placed that they can be turned on their neighbors if the occasion
      arises.</p>

      <p>A Japanese aeroplane soaring over Tsing-tau on Oct. 30 scattered
      thousands of paper handbills on which was printed the following
      announcement, in German, from the Staff Headquarters:</p>

      <p>"To the Honored Officers and Men in the Fortress: It is against the
      will of God as well as the principles of humanity to destroy and render
      useless arms, ships of war, merchantmen, and other works and
      constructions not in obedience to the necessity of war, but merely out of
      spite lest they fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>

      <p>"Trusting, as we do, that, as you hold dear the honor of civilization,
      you will not be betrayed into such base conduct. We beg you, however, to
      announce to us your own view as mentioned above."</p>


      <h3>The German Attack on Tahiti</h3>

      <p class="h3"><b>As Told by Miss Geni La France, an Eyewitness.</b></p>

      <p>SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Oct. 7.&mdash;Graphic stories of the
      plight of Pape&eacute;te, capital of Tahiti, in the Society Islands, were told
      here today by passengers arriving on the Union Steamship Company's liner
      Moana.  Several of those on board the steamer were in Pape&eacute;te when the
      town was bombarded by the German cruisers Gneisenau and Scharnhorst. They
      said the place was in ruins and that the natives were still hiding in the
      hills, whence they fled when the bombardment began.</p>

      <p>The stories of those arriving on the Moana vary only in unimportant
      details. Perhaps the most graphic story was that told by Miss Geni La
      France, a French actress. She told of the Governor's heroism and his
      self-sacrificing devotion to duty, which caused him to face death rather
      than surrender. All of the passengers were loud in their praise of this
      Frenchman, who thought first of his country, next of his guests&mdash;for so
      he considered all travelers&mdash;and next of the city's residents.</p>

      <p>"While the shells screamed and exploded with a deafening roar, tearing
      buildings and leaving wreck and ruin in their wake, this old Governor was
      calm throughout," said Miss La France.</p>

      <p>"It was his bravery that enabled us to bear up under the terrible
      strain, although it was impossible to flee the city, as shells were
      exploding all about.</p>

      <p>"I was sitting on the veranda of the hotel, having a lovely holiday.
      Every one was happy and contented. The sunshine was lovely and warm and
      the natives were busy at their work. I noticed two dark ships steaming up
      the little river, but was too lazy and 'comfy' to take any interest in
      them.</p>

      <p>"Suddenly, without any warning, shots began exploding around us. Two
      of the houses near the hotel fell with a crash, and the natives began
      screaming and running in every direction. For a minute I didn't realize
      what was happening. But when another volley of shells burst dangerously
      near and some of the pieces just missed my head, I was flying, too.</p>

      <p>"Every one was shouting, 'To the hills, to the hills!' My manager
      could not obtain a wagon or any means of conveyance to take me there. I
      felt as if I had on a pair of magic boots that would carry me to the
      hills in three steps. But I didn't. It was a good six miles, over bad
      roads, and we had to run.</p>

      <p>"The shells from the German battleships kept breaking, and the
      explosions were terrible. I am sure that I made a record in sprinting
      that six miles. The cries of the people were terrible. I was simply
      terror-stricken and could not cry for fear. I seemed to realize that I
      must keep my strength in order to reach the hills.</p>

      <p>"We hid in the hills and the natives gave up their homes to the white
      people, and were especially kind to the women."</p>

      <p>"The native population probably hasn't come back from the hills yet,
      and when we left, two days after the bombardment, the European population
      was still dazed," said E.P. Titchener, a Wellington, New Zealand,
      merchant, who went through the bombardment.</p>

      <p>"From 8 o'clock until 10 the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau circled in the
      harbor, firing broadsides of eight-inch guns at the little gunboat Zelie
      and the warehouses beyond.</p>

      <p>"Only the American flag, which the American Consul hoisted, and an
      American sailing vessel also ran up, the two being in line before the
      main European residence section, saved that part of the town, for the
      German cruisers were careful not to fire in that direction."</p>

      <p>According to all accounts, the cruisers directed their fire solely
      toward the Zelie, but their marksmanship was said to be poor. Many shots
      fell short and many went wide, so that the whole business district, the
      general market, and the warehouses along the water front were peppered
      and riddled.</p>

      <p>The French replied from some old guns on the hills as well as three
      shots from the Zelie, but ineffectively.</p>

      <p>"It was plucky of the French to fire at all," said Mr. Titchener. "At
      7 o'clock we could see two war vessels approaching, and soon made out
      they were cruisers. They came on without a flag, and the Zelie, lying in
      the harbor, fired a blank shot.</p>

      <p>"Then the Germans hoisted their flag and the Zelie fired two shots.
      The Germans swung around and fired their broadsides, and all the crew of
      the Zelie scuttled ashore. No one was hurt.</p>

      <p>"The Germans continued to swing and fire. Their shells flew all over
      the town above the berth of the Zelie and the German prize ship Walkure,
      which the Zelie had captured. Perhaps not knowing they were firing into a
      German vessel, the Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst continued their wild
      cannonades.</p>

      <p>"During the two hours of bombardment a hundred shells from the big
      8-inch guns of the cruisers fell and exploded in the town. The sound was
      terrific, and nobody blamed the natives for running away.</p>

      <p>"With all the destruction, only three men were killed&mdash;one Chinaman
      and two natives. The Germans evidently made an effort to confine their
      fire, but many shots went wide, and these did the main mischief.</p>

      <p>"Finally, about 10 o'clock, without attempting to land, and not
      knowing that the German crew of the Walkure were prisoners in the town,
      the Gneisenau and the Scharnhorst steamed away and disappeared over the
      horizon. They sailed off to the westward, but of course we could not tell
      how they set their course when they got beyond our vision."</p>

      <p>The damage to Pape&eacute;te was estimated at $2,000,000. Two vessels were
      sunk and two blocks of business houses and residences were destroyed. The
      French set fire to a 40,000-ton coal pile to prevent the Germans
      replenishing their bunkers.</p>

      <p>The voyage of the Moana was fraught with adventure. From Pape&eacute;te the
      vessel, which flies the British flag, sailed with lights out and dodged
      four German cruisers after being warned by the wireless operator, who had
      picked up a German code message sent out by the cruisers which had razed
      the island city.</p>


      <h3>The Bloodless Capture of German Samoa</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Malcolm Ross, F.R.G.S.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[Special Correspondence of <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span>.]</p>

      <p>WELLINGTON, N.Z., Sept. 19.&mdash;The advance detachment
      of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force which was ordered to seize German
      Samoa left Wellington in two troopships at dawn on Aug. 15, and was met
      in the ocean in latitude 36.0 south, longitude 178.30 east by three of
      the British cruisers in New Zealand waters&mdash;the Psyche, Pyramus, and
      Philomel.</p>

      <p>As it was known that the armored cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau
      were still at large in Pacific waters, it was decided not to go direct to
      Samoa, but to shape a course direct for New Caledonia. For the next
      fortnight or so we were playing a game of hide and seek in the big
      islanded playground of the Pacific Ocean. The first evening out the
      Psyche signaled "Whereabouts of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau still unknown;
      troopships to extinguish all lights and proceed with only shaded lights
      at bow and stern." Military books and papers were quickly gathered
      together, and the remaining few minutes of daylight were used for getting
      into bed, while the difficult task was set us of trying to sleep the
      round of the clock. Thus, night after night, with lights out, we steamed
      along our northward track, the days being spent in drill and ball firing
      with rifles and the Maxim guns.</p>

      <p>On the morning of Aug. 2 we proceeded along the shores of New
      Caledonia and saw the big French cruiser Montcalm entering the harbor.
      Next day we were joined by the battle cruiser Australia and the light
      cruiser Melbourne. The contingent received an enthusiastic reception in
      New Caledonia. As we passed the Montcalm our band played the
      "Marseillaise," and the band on the French cruiser responded with our
      national anthem.  Cheers from the thousands of men afloat and the singing
      of patriotic songs added to the general enthusiasm, the French residents
      being greatly excited with the sudden and unexpected appearance of their
      allies from New Zealand.</p>

      <p>A delay of twenty-four hours was caused by one of the troopships
      grounding on a sand bank in the harbor, but on Sunday, Aug. 23, the
      expedition got safely away.</p>

      <p>We steamed through the Havannah Pass, at the southeastern end of the
      island, where we awaited Rear Admiral Sir George Patey, in command of the
      allied fleets. In due course the Australia and the Melbourne came up with
      us. Then in turn waited for the Montcalm. All the ships, eight in number,
      were now assembled, and they moved off in the evening light to take up
      position in the line ahead.</p>

      <p>Fiji was reached in due course, and at anchor in the harbor of Suva we
      found the Japanese collier Fukoku Maru, and learned that she had been
      coaling the German cruisers at the Caroline Islands just before the
      declaration of war. After the coaling had been completed the Japanese
      Captain went on to Samoa, calling at Apia. The Germans, however, would
      not allow him to land. The Japanese Captain had been paid for his coal by
      drafts on Germany, which, on reaching Suva, he found to be useless.  He
      was therefore left without means to coal and reprovision. As he was not
      allowed to land at Samoa, he went on to Pago-Pago, in complete ignorance
      that war had been declared, and, not being able to get supplies there,
      left for Suva. At the latter port the harbor lights being extinguished,
      he ran his vessel on to the reef in the night time.  Rockets were sent
      up, but no assistance could be given from the shore.  Fortunately,
      however, he got off as the tide made; but it was a narrow call.</p>

      <p>In the early dawn of Aug. 30 we got our first glimpse of German Samoa.
      The American island of Tutuila was out of sight, away to the right, but
      presently we rounded the southeastern corner of the island of Upolu, with
      its beautiful wooded hills wreathing their summits in the morning mists,
      and saw the white line of surf breaking along its coral reef&mdash;historic
      Upolu, the home of Robert Louis Stevenson, the scene of wars and
      rebellions and international schemings, and the scene also of that
      devastating hurricane which wrecked six ships of war and ten other
      vessels, and sent 142 officers and men of the German and American Navies
      to their last sleep. The rusting ribs and plates of the Adler, the German
      flagship, pitched high inside the reef, still stare at us as a reminder
      of that memorable event.</p>

      <p>The Psyche went boldly on ahead, and after the harbor had been swept
      for mines she steamed in, under a flag of truce, and delivered a message
      from Admiral Patey, demanding the surrender of Apia. The Germans, who had
      been expecting their own fleet in, were surprised with the suddenness
      with which an overwhelming force had descended upon them, and decided to
      offer no resistance to a landing. Capt. Marshall promptly made a signal
      to the troopships to steam to their anchorages; motor launches, motor
      surfboats, and ships' boats were launched, and the men began to pour over
      the ships' sides and down the rope ladders into the boats.</p>

      <p>In a remarkably brief space of time the covering party was on shore,
      officers and men dashing out of the boats, up to the knees, and sometimes
      the waist, in water. The main street, the cross-roads, and the bridges
      were quickly in possession of our men, with their Maxims and rifles, and
      then, one after another, the motor boats and launches began to tow
      strings of boats, crammed with the men of the main body, toward the
      shore. The bluejackets of the beach party, who had already landed, urged
      them forward by word and deed in cheery fashion, and soon Apia was
      swarming with our troops.</p>

      <p>Guards were placed all about the Government buildings, and Col. Logan,
      with his staff, was quickly installed in the Government offices.</p>

      <p>Lieut. Col. Fulton dashed off to the telephone exchange and pulled out
      all the plugs, so that the residents could hold no intercommunication by
      that means. The Custom House and the offices of the Governor were also
      seized without a moment's loss of time. An armed party was dispatched
      along a bush road to seize the wireless station. Late that evening the
      man in charge rang up in some alarm to state that there was dynamite
      lying about and that the engine had been tampered with to such an extent
      that the apparatus could not be used until we got our own machinery in
      position.</p>

      <p>Meantime the German flag, that had flown over the island for fourteen
      years, was hauled down, the Germans present doffing their hats and
      standing bareheaded and silent on the veranda of the Supreme Court as
      they watched the soldier in khaki from New Zealand unceremoniously
      pulling it down, detaching it from the rope, and carrying it inside the
      building.</p>

      <p>Next morning the British flag was hoisted with all due ceremony. In
      the harbor the emblem of Britain's might fluttered from the masts of our
      cruiser escort, the Stars and Stripes waved in the tropic breeze above
      the palms surrounding the American Consulate, and out in the open sea the
      white ensign and tricolor flew on the powerful warships of the allied
      fleets of England and France.</p>

      <p>A large crowd of British and other residents and Samoans had gathered.
      In the background were groups of Chinese coolies, gazing wonderingly upon
      the scene. The balconies of the adjoining buildings were crowded with
      British and Samoans. Only the Germans were conspicuous by their absence.
      With undisguised feelings of sadness they had seen their own flag hauled
      down the day before. Naturally they had no desire to witness the flag of
      the rival nation going up in its place.</p>

      <p>A few minutes before 8 o'clock all was ready. Two bluejackets and a
      naval Lieutenant stood with the flag, awaiting the signal. The first gun
      of the royal salute from the Psyche boomed out across the bay. Then
      slowly, to the booming of twenty-one guns, the flag was hoisted to the
      summit of the staff, the officers, with drawn swords, silently watching
      it go up. With the sound of the last gun it reached the top of the
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'fliagstaff']">flagstaff</ins>
      and fluttered out in the southeast trade wind above the tall palms of
      Upolo.</p>

      <p>There was a sharp order from the officer commanding the expedition,
      and the troops came to the royal salute. The national anthem&mdash;never more
      fervently sung&mdash;and three rousing cheers for King George followed.</p>

      <p>Then came the reading of the proclamation by Col. Logan, the troops
      formed up again, and, to the music of the, band of the Fifth Regiment,
      marched back to quarters.</p>


      <h3>How the Cressy Sank</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Edgar Rowan of The London Daily Chronicle.</b></p>

      <p>MUIDEN, Holland, Sept. 23.&mdash;(Dispatch to The London
      Daily Chronicle.)&mdash;When the history of this war comes to be written we
      shall put no black borders, as men without pride or hope, around the
      story of the loss of the cruisers Aboukir, Cressy, and Hogue. We shall
      write it in letters of gold, for the plain, unvarnished tale of those
      last moments, when the cruisers went down, helpless before a hidden foe,
      ranks among the countless deeds of quiet, unseen, unconscious heroism
      that make up the navy's splendid pages.</p>

      <p>It is easy to learn all that happened, for the officers want chiefly
      to tell how splendidly brave the men were, and the men pay a like tribute
      to the officers. The following appears to be a main outline of the
      disaster:</p>

      <p>The three cruisers had for some time been patrolling the North Sea.
      Soon after 6 o'clock Tuesday morning&mdash;there is disagreement as to the
      exact time&mdash;the Aboukir suddenly felt a shock on the port side. A dull
      explosion was heard and a column of water was thrown up mast high. The
      explosion wrecked the stokehole just forward of amidship and, judging by
      the speed with which the cruiser sank, tore the bottom open.</p>

      <p>Almost immediately the doomed cruiser began to settle. Except for the
      watch on deck, most of her crew, were asleep, wearied by constant vigil
      in bad weather, but in perfect order officers and men rushed to quarters.
      Quickfirers were manned in the hope of a dying shot at a submarine, but
      there was not a glimpse of one. Of the few boats carried when cleared for
      action, two were smashed in recent gales and another was wrecked by the
      explosion.</p>

      <p>The Aboukir's sister cruisers, each more than a mile away, saw and
      heard the explosion. They thought the Aboukir had been struck by a mine.
      They closed in and lowered boats. This sealed their own fate, for while
      they were standing by to rescue survivors, first the Hogue and then the
      Cressy was torpedoed.</p>

      <p>The Cressy appears to have seen the submarines in time to attempt to
      retaliate. She fired a few shots before she keeled over, broken in two,
      and sank. Whether she sank any submarines is not known.</p>

      <p>The men of the Aboukir afloat in the water hoped for everything from
      the arrival of her sister cruisers, and all survivors agree that when
      these also sank many gave up the struggle for life and went down. An
      officer told me that when swimming, after having lost his jacket in the
      grip of a drowning man, his chief thought was that the Germans had
      succeeded in sinking only three comparatively obsolete cruisers which
      shortly would have been scrapped anyway.</p>

      <p>Twenty-four men were saved on a target which floated off the Hogue's
      deck. The men were gathered on it for four hours waist deep in water.</p>

      <p>The rescued officers unite in praising the skill and daring of the
      German naval officers, and, far from bearing any grudge, they have
      nothing but professional praise for the submarines' feat.</p>

      <p>"Our only grievance," one said, "is that we did not have a shot at the
      Germans. Our only share in the war has been a few uncomfortable weeks of
      bad weather, mines, and submarines."</p>

      <p>When I entered the billiard room of the hotel here sheltering
      survivors and asked if any British officers were there, several unshaven
      men in the khaki working kit of the Dutch Army or in fishermen's jerseys
      got up from their chairs. Most of them had been saved in their pajamas,
      and they had to accept the first things in the way of clothing offered by
      the kindly Dutch. One Lieutenant apologized for closing the window, as he
      had only a thin jacket over his pajamas. He gladly accepted the loan of
      my overcoat while making a list of his men who had been saved.</p>

      <p>While the survivors are technically prisoners in this neutral country,
      to be interned until the end of the war, Muiden steadfastly refuses to
      regard them as other than honored guests. The soldiers posted before
      every building where officers or men are sheltered seem to be guards of
      honor rather than prison warders, and every one in the place is competing
      for the honor of lending clothes, running errands, or offering cigars for
      the survivors.</p>

      <p>When the Dutch steamer Flora arrived with survivors last night, flying
      her flag at half-mast and signaling for a doctor, the Red Cross
      authorities and the British Vice Consul, Mr. Rigorsberg, at once set the
      machinery in motion, and soon the officers were settled in hotels and the
      men were divided among a hospital, a church, and a young men's
      institute.</p>

      <p>I saw one bluejacket asleep covered with a white ensign. He had
      snatched it up before diving overboard. He held it in his teeth while in
      the water and refused to part with it when rescued. He is now prepared to
      fight any one who may attempt to steal this last relic of his ship.</p>

      <p>One survivor says that an English fishing boat also was sunk by the
      submarines, but the story is not confirmed.</p>

      <p>For hours Capt. Voorham of the Flora and Capt. Berkhout of the Titan,
      caring nothing for risks of mines and submarines, cruised over the scene
      of the disaster, and the gallant Dutch seamen were rewarded by the rescue
      of 400 survivors.</p>

      <p>Capt. Voorham, who landed all the survivors at Muiden, says:</p>

      <p>"We left Rotterdam early Tuesday. In the North Sea we saw a warship,
      which proved to be the Cressy. Not long afterward I saw her keel over,
      break in two and disappear. Our only thought then was to save as many
      survivors as possible. When we got to the spot where she disappeared
      boats approached us and we began to get the men in them aboard. It was a
      very difficult undertaking, as the survivors were exhausted and we were
      rolling heavily.</p>

      <p>"We also lowered our own boats and picked up many from the wreckage.
      All were practically naked and some were so exhausted that they had to be
      hauled aboard with tackle. Each as he recovered at once turned to help my
      small crew to save others. Later I saw the Titan approaching and signaled
      for help.</p>

      <p>"One man was brought aboard with his legs broken. It was touching to
      see how tenderly his mates handled him.</p>

      <p>"Presently the British destroyers approached. A survivor on my ship
      signaled with his arms that he was on a friendly ship, and the warships
      passed on.</p>

      <p>"Among those saved were two doctors, who worked hard to help the
      exhausted men. One man died after they had tried artificial respiration
      for an hour.</p>

      <p>"My men collected all the clothes and blankets on board and gave them
      to the survivors, and the cook was busy getting hot coffee and other food
      for my large party of guests.</p>

      <p>"By 11:30 we had picked up all the survivors we could see. Soon after
      we saw German submarines, and, thinking it best to get to the nearest
      port, called here."</p>

      <p>Remember that Capt. Voorham had only a comparatively small ship and a
      crew of only seventeen and realize the splendid work he did.</p>

      <h3>German Story of the Heligoland Fight</h3>

      <p class="h3">[Special Correspondence of <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span>.]</p>

      <p>LONDON, Sept. 8.&mdash;Copies of the Berliner Tageblatt
      have been received here containing the German account of the recent naval
      battle off Heligoland between British and German vessels.</p>

      <p>"Regarding the sinking of torpedo boat V-187," says the Tageblatt
      account, "an eyewitness says the small craft fought heroically to the
      bitter end against overwhelming odds. Quite unexpectedly the V-187 was
      attacked by a flotilla of English destroyers coming from the north.
      Hardly had the first shot been fired when more hostile destroyers, also
      submarines, arrived and surrounded the German craft.</p>

      <p>"The V-187, on which, in addition to the commander, was the flotilla
      chief, Capt. Wallis, defended itself to the utmost, but the steering gear
      was put out of business by several shots, and thus it was impossible to
      withdraw from the enemy. When the commander saw there was no further
      hope, the vessel was blown up so as not to fall into the enemy's hands.
      But even while she sank the guns not put out of action continued to be
      worked by the crew till the ship was swallowed up in the waves. The
      flotilla commander, as well as Commander Lechler, was lost, besides many
      of the crew.</p>

      <p>"The enemy deserves the greatest credit for their splendid rescue
      work.  The English sailors, unmindful of their own safety, went about it
      in heroic fashion.</p>

      <p>"Boats were put out from the destroyers to save the survivors. While
      this rescue work was still under way stronger German forces approached,
      causing the English torpedo boats to withdraw, abandoning the small
      rescue boats which they had put out, and those who had been saved were
      now taken from the English boats aboard our ships.</p>

      <p>"When the thunder of the guns showed the enemy was near and engaged
      with our torpedo boats, the small armored cruiser Ariadne steamed out to
      take part in the scrap. As the Ariadne neared the outpost vessels it was
      observed that various of our lighter units were fighting with the
      English, which later, however, appeared to be escaping toward the
      west.</p>

      <p>"The long-suppressed keenness for fighting could not be gainsaid and
      the Ariadne pursued, although the fog made it impossible to estimate the
      strength of the enemy. Presently, not far from the Ariadne, two hostile
      cruisers loomed out of the mist&mdash;two dreadnought battle cruisers of
      30,000 tons' displacement, armed with eight 13.5-inch guns. What could
      the Ariadne, of 2,650 tons and armed with ten 4-inch guns, do against
      those two Goliath ships?</p>

      <p>"At the start of this unequal contest a shot struck the forward boiler
      room of the Ariadne and put half of her boilers out of business, lowering
      her speed by fifteen miles. Nevertheless, and despite the overwhelming
      superiority of the English, the fight lasted half an hour.  The stern of
      the Ariadne was in flames, but the guns on her foredeck continued to be
      worked.</p>

      <p>"But the fight was over. The enemy disappeared to the westward. The
      crew of the Ariadne, now gathered on the foredeck, true to the navy's
      traditions, broke into three hurrahs for the War Lord, Kaiser Wilhelm.
      Then, to the singing of 'Deutschland Ueber Alles,' the sinking, burning
      ship was abandoned in good order. Two of our ships near by picked up the
      Ariadne's crew. Presently the Ariadne disappeared under the waves after
      the stern powder magazine had exploded.</p>

      <p>"The first officer, surgeon, chief engineer, and seventy men were
      lost.  In addition, many were wounded."</p>


      <h3>The Sinking of the Cressy and the Hogue</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By the Senior Surviving Officers&mdash;Commander Bertram W.L.
         Nicholson and Commander Reginald A. Norton.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[By the Associated Press.]</p>

      <p>LONDON, Sept. 25.&mdash;The report to the Admiralty on the
      sinking of the Cressy, signed by Bertram W.L. Nicholson, Commander of the
      late H.M.S.  Cressy, follows:</p>

      <p>"Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report in connection
      with the sinking of H.M.S. Cressy, in company with H.M.S. Aboukir and
      Hogue, on the morning of the 22d of September, while on patrol duty:</p>

      <p>"The Aboukir was struck at about 6:25 A.M. on the starboard beam. The
      Hogue and Cressy closed and took up a position, the Hogue ahead of the
      Aboukir, and the Cressy about 400 yards on her port beam. As soon as it
      was seen that the Aboukir was in danger of sinking all the boats were
      sent away from the Cressy, and a picket boat was hoisted out without
      steam up. When cutters full of the Aboukir's men were returning to the
      Cressy the Hogue was struck, apparently under the aft 9.2 magazine, as a
      very heavy explosion took place immediately. Almost directly after the
      Hogue was hit we observed a periscope on our port bow about 300 yards
      off.</p>

      <p>"Fire was immediately opened and the engines were put full speed ahead
      with the intention of running her down. Our gunner, Mr. Dougherty,
      positively asserts that he hit the periscope and that the submarine sank.
      An officer who was standing alongside the gunner thinks that the shell
      struck only floating timber, of which there was much about, but it was
      evidently the impression of the men on deck, who cheered and clapped
      heartily, that the submarine had been hit. This submarine did not fire a
      torpedo at the Cressy.</p>

      <p>"Capt. Johnson then manoeuvred the ship so as to render assistance to
      the crews of the Hogue and Aboukir. About five minutes later another
      periscope was seen on our starboard quarter and fire was opened. The
      track of the torpedo she fired at a range of 500 to 600 yards was plainly
      visible and it struck us on the starboard side just before the
      afterbridge.</p>

      <p>"The ship listed about 10 degrees to the starboard and remained
      steady.  The time was 7:15 A.M. All the watertight doors, deadlights and
      scuttles had been securely closed before the torpedo struck the ship. All
      the mess stools and table shores, and all available timber below and on
      deck, had been previously got up and thrown over side for the saving of
      life.</p>

      <p>"A second torpedo fired by the same submarine missed and passed about
      10 feet astern. About a quarter of an hour after the first torpedo had
      hit a third torpedo fired from a submarine just before the starboard beam
      hit us under the No. 5 boiler room. The time was 7:30 A.M. The ship then
      began to heel rapidly, and finally turned keel up, remaining so for about
      twenty minutes before she finally sank, at 7:55 A.M.</p>

      <p>"A large number of men were saved by casting adrift on Pattern 3
      target.  The steam pinnace floated off her clutches, but filled and
      sank.</p>

      <p>"The second torpedo which struck the Cressy passed over the sinking
      hull of the Aboukir, narrowly missing it. It is possible that the same
      submarine fired all three torpedoes at the Cressy.</p>

      <p>"The conduct of the crew was excellent throughout. I have already
      remarked on the bravery displayed by Capt. Phillips, master of the
      trawler L.T. Coriander, and his crew, who picked up 156 officers and
      men."</p>

      <p>The report to the Admiralty of Commander Reginald A. Norton, late of
      H.M.S. Hogue, follows:</p>

      <p>"I have the honor to report as follows concerning the sinking of the
      Hogue, Aboukir, and Cressy: Between 6:15 and 6:30 A.M., H.M.S. Aboukir
      was struck by a torpedo. The Hogue closed on the Aboukir and I received
      orders to hoist out the launch, turn out and prepare all boats, and
      unlash all timber on the upper deck.</p>

      <p>"Two lifeboats were sent to the Aboukir, but before the launch could
      get away the Hogue was struck on the starboard side amidships by two
      torpedoes at intervals of ten to twenty seconds. The ship at once began
      to heel to starboard. After ordering the men to provide themselves with
      wood, hammocks, &amp;c., and to get into the boats on the booms and take
      off their clothes, I went, by Capt. Nicholson's direction, to ascertain
      the damage done in the engine room. The artificer engineer informed me
      that the water was over the engine-room gratings.</p>

      <p>"While endeavoring to return to the bridge the water burst open the
      starboard entry port doors and the ship heeled rapidly. I told the men in
      the port battery to jump overboard, as the launch was close alongside,
      and soon afterward the ship lurched heavily to starboard.</p>

      <p>"I clung to a ringbolt for some time, but eventually was dropped on to
      the deck, and a huge wave washed me away. I climbed up the ship's side
      and again was washed off. Eventually, after swimming about from various
      overladen pieces of wreckage, I was picked up by a cutter from the Hogue,
      Coxswain L.S. Marks, which pulled about for some hours, picking up men
      and discharging them to our picket boat and steam pinnace and to the
      Dutch steamers Flora and Titan, and rescued, in this way, Commander Sells
      of the Aboukir, Engineer Commander Stokes, (with legs broken,) Fleet
      Paymaster Eldred, and about 120 others.</p>

      <p>"Finally, about 11 A.M., when we could find no more men in the water,
      we were picked up by the Lucifier, which proceeded to the Titan and took
      off from her all our men except about twenty who were too ill to be
      moved.</p>

      <p>"A Lowestoft trawler and the two Dutch ships Flora and Titan were
      extraordinarily kind, clothing and feeding our men. My boat's crew,
      consisting mainly of Royal Navy Reserve men, pulled and behaved
      remarkably well. I particularly wish to mention Petty Officer Halton,
      who, by encouraging the men in the water near me, undoubtedly saved many
      lives.</p>

      <p>"Lieut. Commander Phillips-Wolley, after hoisting out the launch,
      asked me if we should try to hoist out another boat, and endeavored to do
      so.  The last I saw of him was on the after bridge, doing well.</p>

      <p>"Lieut. Commander Tillard was picked up by a launch. He got up a
      cutter's crew and saved many lives, as did Midshipman Cazalet in the
      Cressy's gig. Lieut. Chichester turned out the whaler very quickly.</p>

      <p>"A Dutch sailing trawler sailed close by, but went off without
      rendering any
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'asistance']">assistance,</ins>
      although we signaled to her from the Hogue to close after we were
      struck.</p>

      <p>"The Aboukir appeared to me to take about thirty-five minutes to sink,
      floating bottom up for about five minutes. The Hogue turned turtle very
      quickly&mdash;in about five minutes&mdash;and floated bottom up for several
      minutes. A dense black smoke was seen in the starboard battery, whether
      from coal or torpedo cordite I could not say. The upper deck was not
      blown up, and only one other small explosion occurred and we heeled
      over.</p>

      <p>"The Cressy I watched heel over from the cutter. She heeled over to
      starboard very slowly, dense black smoke issuing from her when she
      attained an angle of about 90 degrees, and she took a long time from this
      angle till she floated bottom up with the starboard screw slightly out of
      water. I consider it was thirty-five to forty-five minutes from the time
      she was struck till she was bottom up.</p>

      <p>"All the men on the Hogue behaved
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'extraordinarly']">extraordinarily</ins>
      well, obeying orders even when in the water swimming for their lives, and
      I witnessed many cases of great self-sacrifice and gallantry. Farmstone,
      an able seaman of the Hogue, jumped overboard from the launch to make
      room for others, and would not avail himself of assistance until all the
      men near by were picked up. He was in the water about half an hour.</p>

      <p>"There was no panic of any sort, the men taking off their clothes as
      ordered and falling in with hammock or wood. Capt. Nicholson, in our
      other cutter, as usual, was perfectly cool and rescued large numbers of
      men. I last saw him alongside the Flora. Engineer Commander Stokes, I
      believe, was in the engine room to the last, and Engineer Lieut.
      Commander Fendick got steam on the boat hoist and worked it in five
      minutes.</p>

      <p>"I have the honor to submit that I may be appointed to another ship as
      soon as I can get a kit."</p>


      <h3>The Sinking of the Hawke</h3>

      <p class="h3">[By a Correspondent of The London Daily Chronicle.]</p>

      <p>ABERDEEN, Scotland, Oct. 16.&mdash;The British cruiser
      Hawke was sunk in the North Sea yesterday by a German submarine, and of
      her crew of 400 officers and men only 73 are known to have been
      saved.</p>

      <p>The cruiser Theseus, a sister ship of the Hawke, was attacked by the
      same submarine, but escaped because she obeyed the Admiralty's
      instructions and looked to her own safety instead of rushing to the aid
      of the Hawke's perishing crew.</p>

      <p>A survivor of the Hawke gives the following description of the
      disaster: "Within eight minutes the Hawke had gone under. Had the ship
      gone down forward or aft there would have been some chance for us to get
      the boats out and clear of the cruiser, but she keeled over on her beam
      ends, and so of all boats we lowered those on the starboard side were
      useless, and those on the port side were crushed as soon as they touched
      the water.</p>

      <p>"I was proud to be among such comrades. Everything was absolutely in
      perfect order. When the ship was struck a fearful explosion followed, and
      grime and dust were everywhere. I was amidships at the time, and could
      hardly see to grope my way to the ship's side. I heard orders given to
      lower the boats, and then some one shouted, 'Look after yourselves!' So I
      did that.</p>

      <p>"Most of the men on board were married men. We saw hundreds in the
      water, but we were afraid to pick them up as our boat was already
      overcrowded. So we threw our lifebelts to them. It was all we could
      do.</p>

      <p>"The weather was bitter cold, and I do not think that many, apart from
      those who were landed at Aberdeen, were saved."</p>

      <p>Here is the statement of a rescued stoker: "When the explosion
      occurred I, along with others who were in the engine room, was sent
      flying into space and was stunned for a time. When I came to my senses I
      found myself in the midst of what must be described as an absolute
      inferno.  One of the cylinders of the engine had been completely wrecked,
      and steam was passing out in dense, scalding clouds. The horror of the
      situation was increased when a tank of oil fuel caught fire, and the
      flames advanced with frightful rapidity.</p>

      <p>"Seeing that there was not a ghost of a chance of doing any good by
      remaining in what was obviously a deathtrap, I determined to make a dash
      for it, and I scrambled up an iron ladder to the main deck. All this had
      happened in less time than it takes to tell it, but such is British
      pluck, coolness, and nerve even in such a situation that the commander
      and other officers were on the bridge, and as calmly as if we were on
      fleet manoeuvres the orders were given and as calmly obeyed.</p>

      <p>"The buglers sounded a stiff call which summoned every man to remain
      at his post. During the first minute or two many of us believed all that
      was wrong was a boiler explosion, but the rapidity with which the cruiser
      was making water on the starboard side quickly disabused all our minds of
      this belief. Realizing the actual situation, the commander gave orders to
      close all the watertight doors. Soon after that came orders to abandon
      the ship and get out the boats.</p>

      <p>"One cutter was being launched from the port side, but the Hawke at
      that moment heeled over before the boat could be got clear, and the
      cutter lurched against the cruiser's side and stove in one or two of her
      planks. As the Hawke went down a small pinnace and a raft which had been
      prepared for such an emergency floated free, but such was the onrush of
      men who had been thrown into the water that both were overcrowded. On the
      raft were about seventy men knee deep in water, and the pinnace also
      appeared to be overfilled.</p>

      <p>"When those who managed to make their way into the cutter, which was
      also in grave danger of being overturned, caught the last glimpse of
      these two craft they were in a precarious condition. The cutter moved
      around the wreck, picking up as many survivors as the boat would hold.
      All those aboard her who had put on lifebelts took them off and threw
      them to their comrades who were struggling in the water. Oars and other
      movable woodwork also were pitched overboard to help those clinging to
      the wreckage, many of whom were seen to sink."</p>


      <h3>The Emden's Last Fight</h3>

      <p class="h3">[By the Cable Operator at Cocos Islands.]</p>

      <p>KEELING, Cocos Islands, Nov. 12, (Dispatch to The
      London Daily Chronicle.)&mdash;It was early on Monday that the unexpected
      arrival of the German cruiser Emden broke the calm of these isolated
      little islands, which the distant news of the war had hitherto left
      unruffled. One of the islands is known as Direction Island, and here the
      Eastern Telegraph Company has a cable station and a staff engaged in
      relaying messages between Europe and Australia. Otherwise the inhabitants
      are all Malays, with the exception of the descendants of June Clunies
      Ross, a British naval officer who came to these islands ninety years ago
      and founded the line of "Uncrowned Kings."</p>

      <p>The war seemed to be very far away. The official bulletins passed
      through the cable station, but they gave us very little real news, and
      the only excitement was when it was rumored that the company was sending
      out rifles in case of a raid on the stations, and orders came that the
      beach must be patrolled by parties on the lookout for Germans. Then we
      heard from Singapore that a German cruiser had been dispatched to these
      islands, and toward the end of August one of the cable staff thought he
      saw searchlights out over the sea. Then suddenly we were awakened from
      our calm and were made to feel that we had suddenly become the most
      important place in the whole worldwide war area.</p>

      <p>At 6 o'clock on Monday morning a four-funneled cruiser arrived at full
      speed at the entrance to the lagoon. Our suspicions were aroused, for she
      was flying no flag and her fourth funnel was obviously a dummy made of
      painted canvas. Therefore we were not altogether surprised at the turn of
      events. The cruiser at once lowered away an armored launch and two boats,
      which came ashore and landed on Coral Beach three officers and forty men,
      all fully armed and having four Maxim guns.</p>

      <p>The Germans&mdash;for all doubt about the mysterious cruiser was now at
      end&mdash;at once rushed up to the cable station, and, entering the office,
      turned out the operators, smashed the instruments, and set armed guards
      over all the buildings. All the knives and firearms found in possession
      of the cable staff were at once confiscated.</p>

      <p>I should say here that, in spite of the excitement on the outside, all
      the work was carried on in the cable office as usual right up to the
      moment when the Germans burst in. A general call was sent out just before
      the wireless apparatus was blown up.</p>

      <p>The whole of the staff was placed under an armed guard while the
      instruments were being destroyed, but it is only fair to say that the
      Germans, working in well-disciplined fashion under their officers, were
      most civil. There was no such brutality as we hear characterizes the
      German Army's behavior toward civilians, and there were no attempts at
      pillaging.</p>

      <p>While the cable station was being put out of action the crew of the
      launch grappled for the cables and endeavored to cut them, but
      fortunately without success. The electrical stores were then blown
      up.</p>

      <p>At 9 A.M. we heard the sound of a siren from the Emden, and this was
      evidently the signal to the landing party to return to the ship, for they
      at once dashed for the boats, but the Emden got under way at once and the
      boats were left behind.</p>

      <p>Looking to the eastward, we could see the reason for this sudden
      departure, for a warship, which we afterward learned was the Australian
      cruiser Sydney, was coming up at full speed in pursuit. The Emden did not
      wait to discuss matters, but, firing her first shot at a range of about
      3,700 yards, steamed north as hard as she could go.</p>

      <p>At first the firing of the Emden seemed excellent, while that of the
      Sydney was somewhat erratic. This, as I afterward learned, was due to the
      fact that the Australian cruiser's range-finder was put out of action by
      one of the only two shots the Germans got home. However, the British
      gunners soon overcame any difficulties that this may have caused and
      settled down to their work, so that before long two of the Emden's
      funnels had been shot away. She also lost one of her masts quite early in
      the fight. Both blazing away with their big guns, the two cruisers
      disappeared below the horizon, the Emden being on fire.</p>

      <p>After the great naval duel passed from our sight and we could turn our
      attention to the portion of the German crew that had been left behind, we
      found that these men had put off in their boats obedient to the signal of
      the siren, but when their ship steamed off without them they could do
      nothing else but come ashore again. On relanding they lined up on the
      shore of the lagoon, evidently determined to fight to the finish if the
      British cruiser sent a party ashore, but the dueling cruiser had
      disappeared, and at 6 P.M. the German raiders embarked on the old
      schooner Ayessa, which belongs to Mr. Ross, the "uncrowned king" of the
      islands. Seizing a quantity of clothes and stores, they sailed out, and
      have not been seen since.</p>

      <p>Early the next morning, Tuesday, Nov. 10, we saw the Sydney returning,
      and at 8:45 A.M. she anchored off the island. From various members of the
      crew I gathered some details of the running fight with the Emden.  The
      Sydney, having an advantage in speed, was able to keep out of range of
      the Emden's guns and to bombard her with her own heavier metal. The
      engagement lasted eighty minutes, the Emden finally running ashore on
      North Keeling Island and becoming an utter wreck.</p>

      <p>Only two German shots proved effective. One of these failed to
      explode, but smashed the main range finder and killed one man. The other
      killed three men and wounded fourteen.</p>

      <p>Each of the cruisers attempted to torpedo the other, but both were
      unsuccessful, and the duel proved a contest in hard pounding at long
      range. The Sydney's speed during the fighting was twenty-six knots and
      the Emden's twenty-four knots, the British ship's superiority of two
      knots enabling her to choose the range at which the battle should be
      fought, and to make the most of her superior guns.</p>

      <p>The Sydney left here at 11 A.M. Tuesday in the hope of picking up any
      of the survivors of the Buresk, the collier that had been in attendance
      on the Emden and was sunk after an engagement on the previous day.
      Finally, with a number of wounded prisoners on board, the Sydney left
      here yesterday, and our few hours of war excitement were over.</p>


      <h3>Crowds See the Niger Sink</h3>

      <p class="h3">[By a Correspondent of The London Daily Chronicle.]</p>

      <p>DEAL, England, Nov. 11.&mdash;By the destruction of the
      British torpedo gunboat Niger, which was torpedoed and sunk by a
      submarine in the Downs this afternoon, the realities of war were brought
      home to the inhabitants of Deal and Walmer.</p>

      <p>A loud explosion was heard from the gunboat as she lay off the Deal
      pier, and great volumes of smoke enveloped the vessel. When the smoke
      cleared the Niger was observed to be settling down forward. Men, women,
      and children rushed to the sea front, exclaiming that the vessel had been
      torpedoed or mined. They soon realized that the Niger was doomed.  The
      Deal and Kingsdown lifeboats as well as boats from other parts of the
      beach were launched in an effort to save the sailors.</p>

      <p>Consternation and almost panic prevailed among the hundreds who stood
      watching the ghastly sight from the beach. Fortunately, the North Deal
      galley Hope, commanded by Capt. John Budd, lay at anchor near the spot,
      waiting to land the pilot from a London steamer which was going down the
      channel. When the boatmen realized that the Niger had been hit by a
      submarine or mine, to use their own expression, they rowed like the very
      devil.</p>

      <p>"We saw the sailors," said Capt. Budd, "jumping from the vessel's side
      in dozens. As we neared the fast-disappearing vessel we came upon swarms
      of men struggling in the sea and heroically helping to support each
      other. Some were fully dressed, others only partly so. They were clinging
      to pieces of wreckage and deck furniture, and some were in lifeboats.</p>

      <p>"It was a heartrending spectacle. The men were so thick in the water
      that they grasped at our oars as we dipped them in the sea. We rescued so
      many and our own boat got so choked that we could not move. With our own
      gunwale only just out of the water, we were in danger of sinking
      ourselves.</p>

      <p>"We called to the men that we could take no more in or we should sink
      ourselves, but they continued to pour over the sides, and some hung to
      the stern of our boat. We had about fifty on board. Never had there been
      so many in the boat before. One burly sailor, whom we told to wait until
      the next boat came along, laughingly
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'remared']">remarked</ins>
      while he was in the water, 'All right, Cocky, I will hold on by my
      eyebrows,' and he drifted to another galley. Another Deal boat then came
      along and relieved us of some of our men.</p>

      <p>"Suddenly we heard a shout, and, looking around, saw the commander of
      the Niger waving and beckoning to us from the stern of the sinking ship.
      We could not go to him because our craft was so heavily laden. Another
      galley then came along, and, after taking out some of our men, together
      with those who were hanging on to our sides, we went closer to the
      sinking gunboat and took off some more men, and at the Captain's special
      request we waited until he took a final look around to see if there were
      any more men left on board the vessel.</p>

      <p>"By this time the ship was very nearly under water, and we shouted to
      him to hurry up, as the Niger had turned over on her side and was likely
      to go down at any moment. That brave Captain only just managed to jump in
      time, when the gunboat gave a lurch and sank on her side in eight fathoms
      of water. We were proud to rescue that Captain, for he was a true
      sailor."</p>

      <p>The other boats which picked up men were the Maple Leaf, the motor
      boat Naru, the Annie, the May, and the Deal lifeboat.</p>

      <p>The rescuing party saw one dead sailor floating by.</p>

      <p>The majority of those rescued received first aid on being landed at
      North Deal, and then they were taken in ambulances to the Marine Hospital
      at Walmer.</p>

      <p>One survivor, replying to a question as to whether the Niger was
      torpedoed or mined, replied:</p>

      <p>"Torpedoed, Sir. With the exception of the watch and the gun crews all
      were below at the time. The first order we received was to close the
      watertight doors."</p>

      <p>So far as I can ascertain at present only one man is missing. Four or
      five have been landed at Ramsgate. The crew is said to have numbered
      ninety-six officers and men.</p>

      <p>The sinking of the Niger came with tragic swiftness. It was
      comparatively a fine, peaceful day, and the people were resting on the
      promenade enjoying sea and fresh air. Anglers&mdash;men and women&mdash;were calmly
      fishing from the pier. One angler whom I interviewed this evening
      said:</p>

      <p>"I had just baited my line and cast it out when I heard two loud
      reports, like an explosion. I looked seaward and saw the Niger, only a
      mile away, enveloped in smoke or steam. When it had cleared away. I said
      to my fellow-anglers, 'Oh, he is letting off steam! When I looked at her
      again I was startled to notice that she was lower in the water.
      Fortunately I had slung across my shoulder a pair of glasses, and, on
      looking at the vessel through them, I noticed that they were attempting
      to lower the boats, while the remainder of the crew stood at attention on
      the deck. We could see that the vessel was sinking, and the lifeboats and
      other boats were hastening to the rescue.</p>

      <p>"The vessel then gradually disappeared, bow first, and after about
      fifteen minutes not a sign of her remained."</p>


      <h3>Lieut. Weddigen's Own Story</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Herbert B. Swope.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[Copyright, 1914, by The Press Publishing Company (The New
      York World).]</p>

      <p>BERLIN, Sept. 30.&mdash;Through the kindness of the German
      Admiralty I am able to tell exclusively the story of Capt. Lieut. Otto
      Weddigen, commander of the now world famous submarine U-9, whose feat in
      destroying three English cruisers has lifted the German Navy to a lofty
      place in sea history.</p>

      <p>There is an inviolable rule in the German Army and Navy prohibiting
      officers from talking of their exploits, but because of the special
      nature of Weddigen's exploit an exception was made, and through the good
      offices of Count von Oppersdorf The World was granted the right of first
      telling Weddigen's remarkable story.</p>

      <p>It must be borne in mind that Lieut. Weddigen's account has been
      officially announced and verified by German Navy Headquarters. That will
      explain why certain details must be omitted, since they are of importance
      if further submarine excursions are undertaken against the British fleet.
      Following is Weddigen's tale, supplemented by the Admiralty Intelligence
      Department:</p>

      <p class="right">By CAPT. LIEUT. OTTO WEDDIGEN.<br />
      Commander of the German Submarine U-9.</p>

      <p>I am 32 years old and have been in the navy for years. For the last
      five years I have been attached to the submarine flotilla, and have been
      most interested in that branch of the navy. At the outbreak of the war
      our undersea boats were rendezvoused at certain harbors in the North Sea,
      the names of which I am restrained from divulging.</p>

      <p>Each of us felt and hoped that the Fatherland might be benefited by
      such individual efforts of ours as were possible at a time when our
      bigger sisters of the fleet were prohibited from activity. So we awaited
      commands from the Admiralty, ready for any undertaking that promised to
      do for the imperial navy what our brothers of the army were so gloriously
      accomplishing.</p>

      <p>It has already been told how I was married at the home of my brother
      in Wilhelmshaven to my boyhood sweetheart, Miss Prete of Hamburg, on Aug.
      16.</p>

      <p>Before that I had been steadily on duty with my boat, and I had to
      leave again the next day after my marriage. But both my bride and I
      wanted the ceremony to take place at the appointed time, and it did,
      although within twenty-four hours thereafter I had to go away on a
      venture that gave a good chance of making my new wife a widow. But she
      was as firm as I was that my first duty was to answer the call of our
      country, and she waved me away from the dock with good-luck wishes.</p>

      <p>I set out from a North Sea port on one of the arms of the Kiel Canal
      and set my course in a southwesterly direction. The name of the port I
      cannot state officially, but it has been guessed at; nor am I permitted
      to say definitely just when we started, but it was not many days before
      the morning of Sept. 22 when I fell in with my quarry.</p>

      <p>When I started from home the fact was kept quiet and a heavy sea
      helped to keep the secret, but when the action began the sun was bright
      and the water smooth&mdash;not the most favorable conditions for submarine
      work.</p>

      <p>I had sighted several ships during my passage, but they were not what
      I was seeking. English torpedo boats came within my reach, but I felt
      there was bigger game further on, so on I went. I traveled on the surface
      except when we sighted vessels, and then I submerged, not even showing my
      periscope, except when it was necessary to take bearings. It was ten
      minutes after 6 on the morning of last Tuesday when I caught sight of one
      of the big cruisers of the enemy.</p>

      <p>I was then eighteen sea miles northwest of the Hook of Holland. I had
      then traveled considerably more than 200 miles from my base. My boat was
      one of an old type, but she had been built on honor, and she was behaving
      beautifully. I had been going ahead partly submerged, with about five
      feet of my periscope showing. Almost immediately I caught sight of the
      first cruiser and two others. I submerged completely and laid my course
      so as to bring up in the centre of the trio, which held a sort of
      triangular formation. I could see their gray-black sides riding high over
      the water.</p>

      <p>When I first sighted them they were near enough for torpedo work, but
      I wanted to make my aim sure, so I went down and in on them. I had taken
      the position of the three ships before submerging, and I succeeded in
      getting another flash through my periscope before I began action. I soon
      reached what I regarded as a good shooting point.</p>

      <p>[The officer is not permitted to give this distance, but it is
      understood to have been considerably less than a mile, although the
      German torpedoes have an effective range of four miles.]</p>

      </div>

      <p>Then I loosed one of my torpedoes at the middle ship. I was then about
      twelve feet under water, and got the shot off in good shape, my men
      handling the boat as if she had been a skiff. I climbed to the surface to
      get a sight through my tube of the effect, and discovered that the shot
      had gone straight and true, striking the ship, which I later learned was
      the Aboukir, under one of her magazines, which in exploding helped the
      torpedo's work of destruction.</p>

      <p>There was a fountain of water, a burst of smoke, a flash of fire, and
      part of the cruiser rose in the air. Then I heard a roar and felt
      reverberations sent through the water by the detonation. She had been
      broken apart, and sank in a few minutes. The Aboukir had been stricken in
      a vital spot and by an unseen force; that made the blow all the
      greater.</p>

      <p>Her crew were brave, and even with death staring them in the face kept
      to their posts, ready to handle their useless guns, for I submerged at
      once. But I had stayed on top long enough to see the other cruisers,
      which I learned were the Cressy and the Hogue, turn and steam full speed
      to their dying sister, whose plight they could not understand, unless it
      had been due to an accident.</p>

      <p>The ships came on a mission of inquiry and rescue, for many of the
      Aboukir's crew were now in the water, the order having been given, "Each
      man for himself."</p>

      <p>But soon the other two English cruisers learned what had brought about
      the destruction so suddenly.</p>

      <p>As I reached my torpedo depth I sent a second charge at the nearest of
      the oncoming vessels, which was the Hogue. The English were playing my
      game, for I had scarcely to move out of my position, which was a great
      aid, since it helped to keep me from detection.</p>

      <p>On board my little boat the spirit of the German Navy was to be seen
      in its best form. With enthusiasm every man held himself in check and
      gave attention to the work in hand.</p>

      <p>The attack on the Hogue went true. But this time I did not have the
      advantageous aid of having the torpedo detonate under the magazine, so
      for twenty minutes the Hogue lay wounded and helpless on the surface
      before she heaved, half turned over and sank.</p>

      <p>But this time, the third cruiser knew of course that the enemy was
      upon her and she sought as best she could to defend herself. She loosed
      her torpedo defense batteries on boats, starboard and port, and stood her
      ground as if more anxious to help the many sailors who were in the water
      than to save herself. In common with the method of defending herself
      against a submarine attack, she steamed in a zigzag course, and this made
      it necessary for me to hold my torpedoes until I could lay a true course
      for them, which also made it necessary for me to get nearer to the
      Cressy. I had come to the surface for a view and saw how wildly the fire
      was being sent from the ship. Small wonder that was when they did not
      know where to shoot, although one shot went unpleasantly near us.</p>

      <p>When I got within suitable range I sent away my third attack. This
      time I sent a second torpedo after the first to make the strike doubly
      certain. My crew were aiming like sharpshooters and both torpedos went to
      their bullseye. My luck was with me again, for the enemy was made useless
      and at once began sinking by her head. Then she careened far over, but
      all the while her men stayed at the guns looking for their invisible foe.
      They were brave and true to their country's sea traditions. Then she
      eventually suffered a boiler explosion and completely turned turtle. With
      her keel uppermost she floated until the air got out from under her and
      then she sank with a loud sound, as if from a creature in pain.</p>

      <p>The whole affair had taken less than one hour from the time of
      shooting off the first torpedo until the Cressy went to the bottom. Not
      one of the three had been able to use any of its big guns. I knew the
      wireless of the three cruisers had been calling for aid. I was still
      quite able to defend myself, but I knew that news of the disaster would
      call many English submarines and torpedo boat destroyers, so, having done
      my appointed work, I set my course for home.</p>

      <p>My surmise was right, for before I got very far some British cruisers
      and destroyers were on the spot, and the destroyers took up the chase. I
      kept under water most of the way, but managed to get off a wireless to
      the German fleet that I was heading homeward and being pursued. I hoped
      to entice the enemy, by allowing them now and then a glimpse of me, into
      the zone in which they might be exposed to capture or destruction by
      German warships, but, although their destroyers saw me plainly at dusk on
      the 22d and made a final effort to stop me, they abandoned the attempt,
      as it was taking them too far from safety and needlessly exposing them to
      attack from our fleet and submarines.</p>

      <p>How much they feared our submarines and how wide was the agitation
      caused by good little U-9 is shown by the English reports that a whole
      flotilla of German submarines had attacked the cruisers and that this
      flotilla had approached under cover of the flag of Holland.</p>

      <p>These reports were absolutely untrue. U-9 was the only submarine on
      deck, and she flew the flag she still flies&mdash;the German naval
      ensign&mdash;which I hope to keep forever as a glorious memento and as an
      inspiration for devotion to the Fatherland.</p>

      <p>I reached the home port on the afternoon of the 23d, and on the 24th
      went to Wilhelmshaven, to find that news of my effort had become public.
      My wife, dry eyed when I went away, met me with tears. Then I learned
      that my little vessel and her brave crew had won the plaudit of the
      Kaiser, who conferred upon each of my co-workers the Iron Cross of the
      second class and upon me the Iron Cross of the first and second
      classes.</p>

      <p>Recently I have been in four of the countries concerned in the present
      war&mdash;Belgium, France, Germany, and England. I was also in Holland, having
      traversed it from end to end within a week after the fall of Antwerp,
      when every road coming up out of the south was filled with Belgian
      refugees.</p>

      <p>In Belgium I saw this:</p>

      <p>Homeless men, women, and children by thousands and hundreds of
      thousands. Many of them had been prosperous, a few had been wealthy,
      practically all had been comfortable. Now, with scarcely an exception,
      they stood all upon one common plane of misery. They had lost their
      homes, their farms, their work-shops, their livings, and their means of
      making livings.</p>

      <p>I saw them tramping aimlessly along wind-swept, rain-washed roads,
      fleeing from burning and devastated villages. I saw them sleeping in open
      fields upon the miry earth, with no cover and no shelter. I saw them
      herded together in the towns and cities to which many of them ultimately
      fled, existing God alone knows how. I saw them&mdash;ragged, furtive
      scarecrows&mdash;prowling in the shattered ruins of their homes, seeking
      salvage where there was no salvage to be found. I saw them living like
      the beasts of the field, upon such things as the beasts of the field
      would reject.</p>

      <p>I saw them standing in long lines waiting for their poor share of the
      dole of a charity which already was nearly exhausted. I saw their towns
      when hardly one stone stood upon another. I saw their abandoned farm
      lands, where the harvests rotted in the furrows and the fruit hung
      mildewed and ungathered upon the trees. I saw their cities where trade
      was dead and credit was a thing which no longer existed. I saw them
      staggering from weariness and from the weakness of hunger. I saw all
      these sights repeated and multiplied infinitely&mdash;yes, and magnified,
      too&mdash;but not once did I see a man or woman or even a child that wept or
      cried out.</p>

      <p>If the Belgian soldiers won the world's admiration by the resistance
      which they made against tremendously overpowering numbers, the people of
      Belgium&mdash;the families of their soldiers&mdash;should have the world's
      admiration and pity for the courage, the patience, and the fortitude they
      have displayed under the load of an affliction too dolorous for any words
      to describe, too terrible for any imagination to picture.</p>

      <p>In France I saw a pastoral land overrun by soldiers and racked by war
      until it seemed the very earth would cry out for mercy. I saw a country
      literally stripped of its men in order that the regiments might be
      filled. I saw women hourly striving to do the ordained work of their
      fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons, hourly piecing together the jarred
      and broken fragments of their lives. I saw countless villages turned into
      smoking, filthy, ill-smelling heaps of ruins. I saw schools that were
      converted into hospitals and factories changed into barracks.</p>

      <p>I saw the industries that were abandoned and the shops that were bare
      of customers, the shopkeepers standing before empty shelves looking
      bankruptcy in the face. I saw the unburied dead lying between battle
      lines, where for weeks they had lain, and where for weeks, and perhaps
      months to come, they would continue to lie, and I saw the graves of
      countless numbers of other dead who were so hurriedly and carelessly
      buried that their limbs in places protruded through the soil, poisoning
      the air with hideous smells and giving abundant promise of the pestilence
      which must surely follow. I saw districts noted for their fecundity on
      the raw edge of famine, and a people proverbial for their
      light-heartedness who had forgotten how to smile.</p>

      <p>In Germany I saw innumerable men maimed and mutilated in every
      conceivable fashion. I saw these streams of wounded pouring back from the
      front endlessly. In two days I saw trains bearing 14,000 wounded men
      passing through one town. I saw people of all classes undergoing
      privations and enduring hardships in order that the forces at the front
      might have food and supplies. I saw thousands of women wearing widow's
      weeds, and thousands of children who had been orphaned.</p>

      <p>I saw great hosts of prisoners of war on their way to prison camps,
      where in the very nature of things they must forego all hope of having
      for months, and perhaps years, those small creature comforts which make
      life endurable to a civilized human being. I saw them, crusted with dirt,
      worn with incredible exertions, alive with crawling vermin, their
      uniforms already in tatters, and their broken shoes falling off their
      feet.</p>

      <p>On the day before I quit German soil&mdash;the war being then less than
      three months old&mdash;I counted, in the course of a short ride through the
      City of Aix-la-Chapelle two convalescent soldiers who were totally blind,
      three who had lost an arm, and one, a boy of 18 or thereabout, who had
      lost both arms. How many men less badly injured I saw in that afternoon I
      do not know; I hesitate even to try to estimate the total figure for fear
      I might be accused of exaggeration.</p>

      <p>In Holland I saw the people of an already crowded country wrestling
      valorously with the problem of striving to feed and house and care for
      the enormous numbers of penniless refugees who had come out of Belgium.
      I saw worn-out groups of peasants huddled on railroad platforms and along
      the railroad tracks, too weary to stir another step.</p>

      <p>In England I saw still more thousands of these refugees, bewildered,
      broken by misfortune, owning only what they wore upon their backs,
      speaking an alien tongue, strangers in a strange land. I saw, as I have
      seen in Holland, people of all classes giving of their time, their means,
      and their services to provide some temporary relief for these poor
      wanderers who were without a country. I saw the new recruits marching
      off, and I knew that for the children many of them were leaving behind
      there would be no Santa Claus unless the American people out of the
      fullness of their own abundance filled the Christmas stockings and
      stocked the Christmas larders.</p>

      <p>And seeing these things, I realized how tremendous was the need for
      organized and systematic aid then and how enormously that need would grow
      when Winter came&mdash;when the soldiers shivered in the trenches, and the
      hospital supplies ran low, as indeed they have before now begun to run
      low, and the winds searched through the holes made by the cannon balls
      and struck at the women and children cowering in their squalid and
      desolated homes. From my own experiences and observations I knew that
      more nurses, more surgeons, more surgical necessities, and yet more, past
      all calculating, would be sorely needed when the plague and famine and
      cold came to take their toll among armies that already were thinned by
      sickness and wounds.</p>

      <p>The American Red Cross, by the terms of the Treaty of Geneva, gives
      aid to the invalided and the injured soldiers of any army and all the
      armies. If any small word from me, attempting to describe actual
      conditions, can be of value to the American Red Cross in its campaign of
      mercy, I write it gladly. I wish only that I had the power to write lines
      which would make the American people see the situation as it is
      now&mdash;which would make them understand how infinitely worse that situation
      must surely become during the next few months.</p>


      <h3>How Paris Dropped Gayety</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Anne Rittenhouse.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[From <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span>, Sept. 23, 1914.]</p>

      <p>On Friday night the Grand Boulevards were alive with
      people, motors, voitures, singing, dancing, and each caf&eacute; thronged by the
      gayest light hearts in the world.</p>

      <p>On Saturday night the boulevards were thronged with growling, ominous,
      surging crowds, with faces like those of the Commune, speaking strong
      words for and against war.</p>

      <p>On Sunday night mobs tore down signs, broke windows, shouted the
      "Marseillaise," wreaked their vengeance on those who belonged to a nation
      that France thought had plunged their country into ghastly war.  Aliens
      sought shelter; hotels closed their massive doors intended for defense.
      Mounted troops corralled the mobs as cowboys round up belligerent cattle.
      Detached groups smashed and mishandled things that came in the way.</p>

      <p>Monday night a calm so intense that one felt frightened. Boulevards
      deserted, caf&eacute;s closed, hotels shuttered. Patrols of the Civil Garde in
      massed formation. France was keeping her pledge to high civilization.
      Yellow circulars were pasted on the buildings warning all that France was
      in danger and appealing by that token to all male citizens to guard the
      women and the weak.</p>

      <p>At daylight only was the dead silence broken; France was marching to
      war at that hour. Will any one who was here forget that daily daybreak
      tramp, that measured march of the thousands going to the front? Cavalry
      with the sun striking the helmets; infantry with their scarlet overcoats
      too large; aviators with their boxed machines, the stormy petrels of
      modern war; and the dogs, veritably the dogs of war, going on the
      humanest mission of all, to search for the wounded in the woods of
      battle.</p>

      <p>And, side by side with the marching millions, on the pavement, were
      the women belonging to them; the women who were to stay behind.</p>

      <p>As though the Judgment Trumpet had sounded, France was changed in the
      twinkling of an eye. And added to that subconscious terror that lurked in
      every American soul of another revolution&mdash;a terror that was dispelled
      after the third day when France reached out her long arm and mobilized
      her people into a strong component whole with but one heart, was an
      inexplainable dread of this terrible calm.</p>

      <p>We knew about trained armies going to war, but here was a situation
      where the Biblical description of the Last Day was carried out, the man
      at the wheel dropped his work and was taken; he who was at the plowshare
      left his furrow....</p>

      <p>First we were afraid we would not have enough to eat. A famine was
      prophesied, and the credulous who know nothing of the vast sources which
      supply France with food clamored to get to England. Then there were
      frenzied stories of hotels closing and prices soaring. None of which
      happened or had any chance of happening. Food was never better, and today
      we have fruit that melts in the mouth; fish that swims in the sauce, the
      lack of which Talleyrand deplored in England; little green string beans
      that no other country produces or knows how to cook.</p>

      <p>Prices never rose for the fraction of a sou. If one had a credit at a
      hotel, all was well, but unless one had ready money in small notes, none
      of the restaurants would accept an order. Here, and here only, was a snag
      concerning food. It is true that women went for twenty-four hours without
      food, but the reason was the lack of small change, not of eatables.</p>

      <p>After the panic caused by a thousand rumors annexed to a dozen
      disheartening and revolutionary conditions, after the people felt that
      the Commune was the figment of imagination, not inspired prophecy; that
      money was getting easier; that, above all, America was looking after its
      own, though her move toward that end seemed to take months instead of
      days, and because we counted by heart-beats, not calendars; after all
      this, we found time and interest to observe the phenomena around us. We
      began to feel ashamed of our petty madness on the worldly subject of
      money and ships and safe passage home; our passionate, twentieth century,
      overindulged selves who were neither fighting nor giving our beloveds in
      battle, and who were harassing those who were in a death struggle. Never
      throughout the centuries to come, whether the map of Europe is changed or
      not, should the stranger within her gates ever forget the courtesy of
      Paris.</p>

      <p>At night powerful searchlights backed up by artillery guard the city
      from the monster of the air.</p>

      <p>This is fiction come true. It is Conan Doyle, Kipling, Wells come to
      measure. From the moment of sunset until sunrise those comets with an
      orbit patrol the skies. Pointing with blazing fingers to the moon and the
      stars, to the horizon, they proclaim that Paris watches while her people
      sleep.</p>

      <p>The idea has given comfort to thousands. You, in your safe, tranquil
      homes, cannot know the pleasure it gives to look out of the window in the
      wakeful nights and watch those wheeling comets circling, circling to
      catch the Zeppelin that may come.</p>

      <p>And behind the light is the gun. Rooftop artillery! The new warfare!
      On the roof of the fashionable Automobile Club on the Place de la
      Concorde the little blue firing guns wheel with the blazing fingers.
      Always ready to send shot and shell into a bulging speck in the sky that
      does not return the luminous signals. So on the roof of the Observatoir,
      so on the encircling environs; sometimes three, sometimes six, they are
      always going. People stand in the streets to watch, hypnotized by the
      moment into horizon gazing. There will be a speck in the sky; people grow
      tense; the comet catches it; is that wigwagging on the roof, those
      challenges in fire, returned? No. The speck passes; we breathe again.
      And so it goes: a ceaseless centre of interest. It is the novelty of the
      world war.</p>

      <p>The highest artillery in the world is on the Eiffel Tower. At its
      dizzy top, pointing to the sky, are machine guns that are trained to fire
      at an enemy's balloon. It is an answer to the prayer of the people that
      these guns have not yet been used.</p>

      <p>But it is not only in the artillery on the top of the Eiffel Tower
      that interest centres; it is in the wireless that sends the messages to
      land and sea, safeguarding armies and navies, patrolling the earth and
      water.  Strange, isn't it, that the plaything of a nation has become its
      safeguard?</p>

      <p>That was a stirring day when Paris sang "God Save the King." Gen.
      French arrived from London, coming quietly to confer with M. Viviani, the
      Minister for War, and with President Poincar&eacute;. He was the first English
      General to come to the aid of France since Cromwell commissioned the
      British Ambassador to go to the aid of Anne of Austria. And the French
      heart responded as only it can; the people stood, with raised hats, in
      quadruple rows wherever he passed, as English, French, and foreign voices
      sang a benediction to Britain's King. History was made there.</p>

      <p>That night Gen. French dined at the Ritz among a few friends. Even the
      newspapers seemed not to know it, and those of us who had the good chance
      to be there enjoyed him at leisure. He wore his field uniform of khaki in
      strong contrast to the French Generals, who are always in glittering
      gold, although he represents an empire and they a republic.  He is an
      admirable looking soldier, somewhat small of stature, firmly knit,
      bronzed, white haired, blue eyed, calm. He spoke of their
      responsibilities without exaggeration or amelioration. He did not make
      light of the task before his soldiers, and his grave manner seemed a
      prophecy of that terrible fight near Mons, above the French frontier,
      which was so soon to take place and where English blood was freely
      spilled for France's sake.</p>

      <p>Another day that we shall be glad we saw when it is written into the
      narrative history of this Summer by some future Mme. Sevigne, was when
      the first German flag arrived. Before it came, two soldiers exhibited a
      German frontier post in front of a caf&eacute; on the boulevard, which started
      the excitement, but the reception of the flag by the Government and its
      placement in the Invalides, where is Napoleon's tomb, was an hour of
      dramatic tenseness.</p>

      <p>The only music heard in Paris since the first day of August, the day
      of mobilization, accompanied this flag to its resting place along with
      those historic relics of former French victories. The procession went
      over the Alexander Bridge, that superb structure dedicated in honor of
      the Russian Czar, whose son is now fulfilling his pledge of friendship to
      France. The flag was met at the Invalides by the old soldiers who bore
      medals of the Franco-Prussian war. In the solemn inclosure, where all
      stood at salute, the veterans stood with lances. The flag was presented
      to an old sick soldier, who stumped forward on a wooden leg, his breast
      covered with the medals of the Crimea and the Italian campaign. He
      received it for France, and when it was placed over the organ, the
      listening crowds that jammed the Place des Invalides heard the singing of
      the "Marseillaise" by the cracked old voices first, then by the sturdier
      younger voices, and so it joined in, this vast concourse of solemn
      listeners.</p>

      <p>France has gone into this war with the spirit of the Crusaders, but
      the spirit of French wit cannot be repressed even under the most
      terrifying conditions. So after the news of the superhuman effort made by
      that national baby, Belgium, in detaining the huge German forces for many
      days, there was a placard on one of the gates at the station, placed
      there by some gay refugee, saying that a train de luxe would leave for
      Berlin the next day.</p>

      <p>It tickled the sensibilities of travelers very much, and it gave rise
      to the sale of postcards by an enterprising soul. These cards gave one
      the right, so they said, of a daily train to Berlin to visit the tomb of
      Guillame. They were bought by the thousands as souvenirs of the war and
      as one of the few things that caused a smile in this saddened city.</p>

      <p>Another incident that amused the people was the remark of a young
      soldier who had single-handed taken some German prisoners, and who, when
      asked whether he had done it by the revolver or the bayonet, answered
      that he had only held out a slice of bread and butter and the Germans had
      followed him.</p>

      <p>Amusement and irritation followed the order that all telephoning must
      be done in French. The sensation produced depended on the temperament of
      the person. Certainly queer things were said over the lines, and no one
      could blame the "Allo girl" for laughing. The majority of Americans took
      it in good part by saying that it was a French lesson for five cents.</p>

      <p>Another accomplishment that has been furthered in Paris during the
      last three weeks is bicycle riding. With the paucity of transportation
      some means of getting over the magnificent distances of this city had to
      be found. So people who could ride rented bicycles, and those who had not
      learned began to take lessons. The girls who work, and those who go on
      errands for the Croix Rouge, wear a most attractive costume of pale blue
      or violet. It has a short divided skirt, a slim blouse with
      blue-and-white striped collar; there is a small hat to match, and the
      young cyclists whirling around on their missions of mercy are a pleasant
      sight for very sad eyes.</p>


      <h3>Paris in October</h3>

      <p class="h3">[From The London Times, Oct. 21, 1914.]</p>

      <p class="right">PARIS, Oct. 19.</p>

      <p>The more one studies the life of Paris at the present
      time, and especially its patriotic and benevolent activities, the more is
      one impressed by the unanimous determination of its inhabitants to face
      whatever may befall and to make the best of things. It is difficult to
      realize at first sight how completely, in the hour of trial, the
      traditional light-heartedness of the Parisian has been translated to a
      fine simplicity of courage and devotion to the common cause and to a high
      seriousness of patriotism. There is something splendidly impressive and
      stimulating in the spectacle of civilization's most sensitive culture
      suddenly confronted by the stern realities of a life-and-death struggle,
      and responding unanimously to the call of duty. Without hesitation or
      complaint, Paris has put away childish things, her toys, her luxury, and
      her laughter; today her whole life reflects only fixed purposes of united
      effort, of courage never, never to submit or yield, and this splendid
      determination is all the more significant for being undemonstrative and
      almost silent.</p>

      <p>We English people, who, observing chiefly the surface life of the
      French capital, have generally been disposed to regard the Parisian
      temperament as mutable and often impatient of adversity, must now make
      our confession of error and the amende honorable; for nothing could be
      more admirable than the attitude of all classes of the community in their
      stoic acceptance of the sacrifices and sufferings imposed upon them by
      this war at their gates. Especially striking is the philosophic
      acquiescence of the city, accustomed to know and to discuss all things,
      in the
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'impentrable']">impenetrable</ins>
      veil of secrecy which conceals the movements and the fortunes of the
      French armies in the field. Go where you will, even among those of the
      very poor who have lost their breadwinners, and you will hear few
      criticisms and no complaints.  The little midinette thrown out of
      employment, the shopkeeper faced with ruin, the artist reduced to actual
      want&mdash;they also are in the fighting line, and they are proud of it. The
      women of the thrifty middle class consider it just as much their duty to
      devote their savings of years to the common cause as their husbands and
      brothers do to bear arms against the enemy; only in the last extremity of
      need do they make appeal to the "Secours National" for assistance. And
      when they do, they are well content to live on a maintenance allowance of
      1s. a day and 5d. for every child.</p>

      <p>The other Sunday morning at the hour of mass, when two German
      aeroplanes were engaged in their genial occupation of throwing bombs over
      the residential and business quarters of the city, I assisted at several
      sidewalk conversations in the district lying between the Madeleine and
      the Rue de Rivoli. Nowhere did I find the least sign of excitement.
      Indeed, there was curiously little interest shown as to the results of
      the explosions in that neighborhood; only a grim acceptance of this daily
      visitation as something to be added to the score in the final day of
      reckoning and some expression of surprise that the French aeroplanes
      (supposed to be constantly on the alert for these visitors) should not
      have found some means of putting an end to the nuisance. At the same time
      I heard several spectators express their admiration of the German
      aviators' courage and appreciation of the ease and grace with which they
      handled their beautiful machines. In the caf&eacute;s that evening, when the
      full list of the casualties and damage had been published, one heard a
      good deal of criticism, seasoned with Attic salt, on the subject of the
      belated appearance of the French aeroplanes on the scene, and hopes that
      the boulevards might soon be rewarded by the spectacle of a duel in the
      air. They seem to think they have earned it.</p>

      <p>But in the afternoon all Paris was out&mdash;in the Jarden des Tuileries,
      in the Bois, at Vincennes, basking in the sunshine of a glorious Autumn
      day, Madame et B&eacute;b&eacute; bravely making the best of it in the absence of
      Monsieur. (Not that Monsieur is always absent; the proportion of men in
      the crowd, and men of serviceable age, was considerably larger than one
      might have expected.) If the object of the German aviators is to instill
      terror into the hearts of the Parisians they are wasting their time and
      their bombs.</p>

      <p>Those people in London who complain about not being able to get supper
      after the theatre, and other minor disturbances of their even tenor of
      existence, should spend a few days in Paris. They would observe how
      easily a community may learn to do without many things, and how the
      lesson itself becomes a moral tonic, unmistakably stimulating in its
      effects.</p>

      <p>Paris is reminded every morning of duty and discipline when it begins
      by doing without its beloved petits pains and croissants for breakfast,
      the order having gone forth that bakers, being short-handed, are to make
      only pain de m&eacute;nage. Similarly, because the majority of journalists and
      popular writers are under arms, Paris does without its accustomed daily
      refreshment of ephemeral literature, its comic and illustrated press, its
      literary and artistic causeries, its feuilletons, and chroniques. It does
      without its theatres, its music halls, without politics, art, and social
      amenities, without barbers, florists, and motor cars, partly because
      there are not men enough to keep these things going, and partly because,
      even if there were, la patrie comes first, so that thrifty self-denial
      has become the duty of every good citizen. If the telephone breaks down,
      (as it usually does,) there is no one to repair it, so the subscriber
      goes without; if the trains and trams cease running on regular schedules
      the Parisian accepts the fact and stays at home.</p>

      <p>In normal times life is made up of the sum of little things, but at
      great moments the little things cease to count. How true this is in Paris
      today one may judge from the correspondence and records of the "Secours
      National"; they reveal an intense and widespread impulse of personal
      pride in self-denial, and prove that the heart of the Parisian
      bourgeoisie is sound to the core.</p>

      <p>To a foreigner, accustomed to the Paris of literary and artistic
      traditions, perhaps the most remarkable feature in the life of the city
      today lies in the absence of articulate public opinion, and apparently of
      public interest, in everything outside the immediate issues of the war.
      With one or two exceptions, such as the Temps and the D&eacute;bats, the press
      of the capital practically confines itself to recording the events and
      progress of the campaign; nothing else matters. So far as Paris is
      concerned, all the rest of the world, from China to Peru, might be
      non-existent. Neither the political nor the economic consequences of the
      war are seriously examined or discussed; the sole business of the
      newspapers consists in supplementing, to the best of their abilities, the
      meagre war news supplied through official channels. Some interest
      attaches, of course, to the attitude of Italy; but, beyond that, all
      things sublunary seem to have faded into a remote distance of
      unreality&mdash;sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p>

      <p>The
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'explaantion']">explanation</ins>
      of this attitude of complete detachment lies, no doubt, chiefly in the
      fact that the men who make and exchange political opinions have gone to
      Bordeaux, while most of those who create and guide public (as distinct
      from political) opinion, have exchanged the pen for the sword. Just as
      Paris, for want of bakers, has only one kind of bread, so, for want of
      the men who usually inspire public opinion, her press has concentrated
      upon one absorbing idea, &eacute;craser les allemands. Moreover, for want of
      printers and of advertisers, most of the daily papers have now dwindled
      to microscopic proportions. The virile intelligence of Paris journalism
      and the nimble and adventurous inquisitiveness, which are its normally
      distinguishing characteristics, have gone, like everything else, to the
      front. As the editor of the Gil Blas says in a farewell poster to his
      subscribers: "Youth has only one duty to perform in these days. Our chief
      and all the staff have joined the colors. Whenever events shall permit,
      Gil Blas will resume its cheerful way. A bien-t&ocirc;t."</p>


      <h3>France and England As Seen in War Time</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>An Interview With F. Hopkinson Smith.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[From <span class="pscaps">The New York Times Sunday Magazine</span>, Dec. 6,
      1914.]</p>

      <p>F. Hopkinson Smith was in France when the war broke
      out, he spent September in London, and is now back in New York. He has
      brought home many sketches. Not sketches which suggest war in the least,
      but which were made with the thought of the war lurking in the
      background.</p>

      <p>"Curiously enough," he said, without waiting for any opening question
      from <span class="pscaps">The Times</span> reporter&mdash;Mr. Smith often interviews himself&mdash;"curiously
      enough, I was on my way to Rheims to make a sketch of the Cathedral when
      the war broke out. I had started out to make a series of sketches of the
      great European cathedrals. Not etchings, but charcoal sketches.</p>

      <p>"Let me say here, too, that cathedrals for the most part ought not to
      be etched. You lose too many shadows, though you gain in line; but in the
      etching you have to cross-hatch so heavily with ink that the result is
      just ink, and not shadow at all. Charcoal gives you depth and
      transparency. I was eager to do a series of the cathedrals, as I had done
      a series for the Dickens and Thackeray books, and had planned to give my,
      entire Summer to it.</p>

      <p>"I had been in London for some time. I had sketched in Westminster, in
      St. Bartholomew's. Everything peaceful and quiet. It seems now as if we
      ought to have felt&mdash;all of us, the people on the streets, I, shopkeepers,
      every one&mdash;the approach of this tremendous war. But we didn't, of course.
      No one in England had the faintest suspicion that this terrible inhuman
      thing was going to happen.</p>

      <p>"I went on to France. I sketched Notre Dame, over which they exploded
      shells a month or so later. I did some work in the beautiful St.
      Etienne. I sauntered down into South Normandy and was stopping for a
      little color work at the Inn of William the Conqueror before going on to
      Rheims."</p>

      <p>These water colors of French farms, French inns, and French gardens
      are glimpses caught at the very eleventh hour before France put on a
      totally different aspect.</p>

      <p>"The war broke out. There at the quiet little French inn everything
      suddenly changed color. It was quick, it was quiet. There was a complete
      change in the snap of a finger. All the chauffeurs and the porters and
      the waiters&mdash;men who had been there for years and with whom we who visit
      there Summer after Summer have grown familiar&mdash;suddenly stopped work,
      gave up their jobs, were turned into soldiers. One hardly recognized
      them.</p>

      <p>"We were all stunned. I realized that I could not go on to Rheims,
      that I probably should not get down into Italy. I scarcely realized at
      first what that meant. I could not conceive, none of us could conceive,"
      Mr.  Smith exploded violently, "that any one, under any necessity
      whatsoever, should lay hands on the Rheims Cathedral. It's too monstrous!
      The world will never forgive it, never!</p>

      <p>"The world is divided, I tell you! It is not a Double Alliance and a
      Triple Entente; it is not a Germany and a Russia and a United States and
      an Italy and an England. That is not the division of the world just now.
      There are two sides, and only two sides. There is barbarism on the one
      hand, civilization on the other; there is brutality and there is
      humanity. And humanity is going to win, but the sacrifices are
      awful&mdash;awful!"</p>

      <p>"How about the feeling in France, Mr. Smith?"</p>

      <p>"I can't tell you how overwhelmingly pathetic it is&mdash;the sight of
      these brave Frenchmen. Every one has remarked it. Once and for all the
      tradition that the French are an excitable, emotional people with no grip
      on their passions and no rein on their impulses&mdash;that fiction is dead for
      all time.</p>

      <p>"I saw that whole first act of France's drama. I saw the French people
      stand still on that first day and take breath. Then I saw France set to
      work. She was unprepared, but she was ready in spirit. There was no
      excitement, there were no demonstrations. The men climbed into their
      trains without any exhibitions of patriotism, without any outbursts.
      There were many women crying quietly, with children huddled about their
      skirts.</p>

      <p>"The spirit of England is different, but there is the same lack of
      excitement. I chartered a motor bus when the war broke out and got to
      Paris, and then went back to London, where I sketched for a month, saw my
      friends, and talked war.</p>

      <p>"Making sketches in war time is very different, by the way, from
      making sketches in time of peace. It is a business full of possibilities,
      when all manner of spy suspicions are afloat. I made up my mind to do a
      sketch of the Royal Exchange. Not as I should have done it a year before,
      mind you, nor even three months before, but now, with the thought of
      bomb-dropping Zeppelins in the back of my mind. It occurred to me when I
      was hurrying along one rainy evening in a taxi past the Stock Exchange,
      the Globe Insurance, the Bank of England. Everywhere cabs drawn up along
      the curbing, cabs slipping past, people, great moving crowds of people
      with their umbrellas up, moving off down Threadneedle and Victoria.</p>

      <p>"A lot of human life and some very beautiful architecture and a good
      part of the world's business, all concentrated here. And I thought to
      myself what might happen should the cultured Germans get as far as
      London, and should the defenders of the world's civilization drop a bomb
      down into the heart of things here. I pictured to myself what havoc could
      be wrought.</p>

      <p>"And I thought, too, of places like Southwark. Ever been in Southwark?
      Horrible. A year before, when I was making the sketches for my Dickens
      book, I spent a great deal of time in the Southwark section. Now, with
      the prospect of Zeppelins, I thought again of Southwark. A bomb in a
      Southwark street! Good Lord, can you imagine the horror of it! There
      fifty or sixty families are packed into a single tenement, and the houses
      in their turn are packed one against the next along streets so narrow
      that the buildings seem to be nodding to each other, touching foreheads
      almost. Desperately poor people, children swarming every moment of the
      day and night up and down these dark stairways, up and down these
      hideously dark streets. Now drop a bomb in the midst of it all. That is
      what Englishmen are thinking of now.</p>

      <p>"I didn't go over into Southwark; I couldn't stand it. The next day I
      went back to the Stock Exchange to make my sketch. I've done sketches in
      London before&mdash;every nook and cranny of it&mdash;but this time I felt a little
      nervous when I got there with my umbrella and my little tools.  But I
      managed it. I said to the bobby, I said&mdash;"</p>

      <p>And then Mr. Smith, getting up from his chair and relapsing into the
      frown that always means he is going to tell a story, showed how he
      managed it. It is impossible to reproduce Mr. Smith's inimitable
      manner.</p>

      <p>"'Are you, now?' said I.</p>

      <p>"'Well, 'ow can I tell?' said he.</p>

      <p>"'But if you're the excellent English bobby that I believe you to be,'
      said I, 'you'll see at once that I'm an honest American artist just here
      to do a little sketching.'</p>

      <p>"'I tell you,' said he. W'y don't you just pop hup and see 'Is
      Lordship the Mayor?'</p>

      <p>"And so I did pop up and I told the Lord Mayor my troubles, and he
      waved me a hearty wave of his hand and said he'd do anything to oblige an
      American, and I came down again, and here was the bobby still very
      upright but watching my approach from the tail of his eye. And I
      pretended I had never seen him, but as I went past I slipped him a cigar,
      and when I passed back again he twinkled his eye. Stuck between the
      buttons of his coat, there being no other place, was my fat cigar.</p>

      <p>"I made my sketch of the Royal Exchange. I want Americans to see what
      can happen if His Imperial Lowness over on the Continent sees fit to send
      his Zeppelins to England. Not being big enough nor strong enough to
      injure England vitally, he can take this method of injury, he can injure
      women and children and maim horses, destroy business and works of art and
      blow up the congested districts.</p>

      <p>"We have seen what the Savior of the World's Culture could do in
      France and Belgium; it is small wonder that all England has in the back
      of her head surmises as to what he might accomplish if some of his air
      craft crossed the Channel. By which I do not mean to say that the English
      are apprehensive. They are not nervous. I have spent more than a month
      with them, among my own friends, learning the general temper of the
      country.</p>

      <p>"There are no demonstrations, there is no boasting, no display. London
      is much the same as it always was. At night London is darkened, in
      accordance with the order of Oct. 9, but that is about all the
      difference. It is so dark that you can hardly get up Piccadilly, but
      London takes her amusements about as usual. The theatres are not
      overcrowded, but neither are they empty. For luncheons and for dinners
      Prince's is full, the Carlton is full. The searchlights are playing over
      the city looking for those Zeppelins. That is a new wrinkle to me; the
      idea of blinding the men up there at the wheel with a powerful light is a
      good one.</p>

      <p>"These Englishmen have their teeth set. They know perfectly well that
      they are fighting for their existence. All this talk of the necessity of
      drumming up patriotism in England is bosh. England has no organized
      publicity bureau such as Germany, and in contrast she may have seemed
      quiet to the point of apathy. But don't fancy that Englishmen are
      apathetic. They are slow and they are sure. They are just beginning to
      realize that they have these fellows by the back of the necks. Before I
      left London I saw every day in the Temple Gardens, down by the
      Embankment, that steady drill of thousands of young men in straw hats,
      yellow shoes, and business suits. I felt their spirit.</p>

      <p>"There is a great fundamental difference between the spirit of Germany
      and the spirit of the Allies, and the whole world has recognized it.
      With the Allies there has been no boasting, even now when they realize
      that the top is reached and this war is on the down grade. There is
      determination, but there is no cock-sureness, no goose-step. There is no
      insolence.</p>

      <p>"Why, in the last analysis, is the whole world against Germany?
      Because of her insufferable insolence. It is an insolence which has been
      fairly bred in the bone of every German soldier. I can give you a little
      concrete instance. My daughter-in-law had been serving in one of the
      Paris hospitals ever since the war broke out. She was finally placed on a
      committee which was to meet the trainloads of wounded soldiers when they
      first arrived.</p>

      <p>"In one of the cars one day there was a wounded officer, a German. He
      spoke no French, and a young French Lieutenant, very courteous, was
      trying to make him understand something. My daughter, too, had no
      success. Finally a young German, a common soldier who was in the same
      car, said to this German officer: 'I am an Alsatian; I can interpret for
      you.'</p>

      <p>"'How dare you!' And the German officer turned to him in perfect fury.
      'How do you, a common soldier, dare to speak to me, an officer!' And with
      that he struck the Alsatian full in the face with what little strength he
      had left.</p>

      <p>"Now there is an example of the attitude to which the German military
      has been trained.</p>

      <p>"On another occasion, when a French officer, after one of the battles,
      came courteously to the commanding German officer of the division and
      said, 'Sir, you are my prisoner,' the German spat in his face. That is
      all very dramatic and you may say that he showed much spirit, but you
      could hardly call it a sporting spirit, surely not a civilized
      spirit.</p>

      <p>"It is this domineering spirit that the whole world is resenting.
      Nothing that Germany can do through her well-organized press agents can
      conceal that insolence which has been a continuous policy for many years.
      American opinion is almost unanimous in its opposition to Germany for
      this one reason.</p>

      <p>"Sir Gilbert Parker recently sent me a whole bundle of papers asking
      me to judge England's case fairly and ask my friends in America to do the
      same. I wrote back and asked him: 'Why do you waste stamps sending
      evidence to America? America has the evidence, and if there has been any
      anti-English feeling in America, von Bernstorff and Dernburg long since
      demolished it.'</p>

      <p>"The world has never witnessed anything so far-reaching as this policy
      of insolence. Men who in daily life are cultured and fine, whose ideals
      are high and noble, who have achieved names for themselves in literature,
      art, and science&mdash;we all have many friends among them&mdash;have become
      unconsciously tinctured with this policy. They are intelligent men, but,
      by the gods, when they get on this subject of Germany's place in the sun,
      they become paranoiacs! This idea of their pre-eminence has become a
      disease with Germany. Germany is actually sick with it, and the medicine
      that will cure her will be pretty bitter.</p>

      <p>"I see that George Bernard Shaw presumes to announce that this policy
      of insolence, this extreme militarism, has been just as prominent in
      England and in France. Mr. Shaw is great fun and very wise about a lot of
      things; moreover, he has lived in England a great deal longer than I
      have, but just the same he is dead wrong when he makes such a statement.
      I have many old friends in the army and the navy, many in politics, and
      some of them are of the pronounced soldier, the militarist type. Not one
      of them would ever dare to write such a book as Bernhardi has written,
      and I don't believe there's one of them that would take any stock in a
      man like Nietzsche. Mr. Shaw is dead wrong here; worse than that, he is
      writing nonsense.</p>

      <p>"We live from day to day hoping that the end will be the absolute
      annihilation of the militarist principle, this get-off-the-earth
      attitude.</p>

      <p>"And what has all this," concluded Mr. Smith suddenly, "to do with
      art?  I'm sure I don't know. No one is thinking about art now."</p>

      <p>"But you haven't told me where your sympathies are in this war, Mr.
      Smith."</p>

      <p>"Hey? I don't have any sympathies, as you see. I'm neutral as
      President Wilson bids me be; I don't care who licks Germany, not even if
      it is Japan."</p>


      <h3>The Helpless Victims</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Mrs. Nina Larrey Duryee.</b></p>

      DINARD, France, Sept. 1, 1914.</p>

      <p class="noindent"><i>To the Editor of The New York Times</i>:</p>

      <p>This is written in great haste to catch the rare boat
      to England. The author is an American woman, who has spent nine happy
      Summers in this beautiful corner of France, where thousands of her
      compatriots have likewise enjoyed Brittany's kindly hospitality.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I saw issuing through St. Malo's eleventh century gates 300
      Belgian refugees, headed by our Dinard Mayor, M. Cralard. I try to write
      calmly of that procession of the half-starved, terror-ridden throng, but
      with the memory of those pinched faces and the stories we heard of
      murder, carnage, burning towns, insulted women, it is difficult to
      restrain indignation. They had come from Charleroi and Mons&mdash;old men,
      women, and little children. Not a man of strength or middle age among
      them, for they are dead or away fighting the barbarians who invested
      their little country against all honorable dealings.</p>

      <p>Such a procession! They had slept in fields, eaten berries, carrots
      dug from the earth by their hands; drunk from muddy pools, always with
      those beings behind them who had driven them at the point of their
      bayonets from their poor homes. Looking back, they had seen flames
      against the sky, heard screams for pity from those too ill to leave,
      silenced by bullets.</p>

      <p>Here are some of the tales, which our Mayor vouches for, which I
      heard:</p>

      <p>One young mother, who had seen her husband shot, tried to put aside
      the rifle of the assassin. She was holding her year-old baby on her
      breast.  The butt of that rifle was beaten down, crushing in her baby's
      chest. It still lives, and I heard it's gasping breath.</p>

      <p>Another young girl, in remnants of a pretty silk dress, hatless, her
      fragile shoes soleless, and her feet bleeding, is quite mad from the
      horrors of seeing her old father shot and her two younger brothers taken
      away to go before the advancing enemy as shields against English bullets.
      She has forgotten her name, town, and kin, and, "like a leaf in the
      storm," is adrift on the world penniless.</p>

      <p>I saw sitting in a row on a bench in the shed seven little girls, none
      of them more than six. Not one of them has now father, mother, or home.
      None can tell whence they came, or to whom they belong. Three are plainly
      of gentle birth. They were with nurses when the horde of Prussians fell
      upon them, and the latter were kept&mdash;for the soldier's pleasure.</p>

      <p>There is an old man, formerly the proud proprietor of a bakery, who
      escaped with the tiny delivery cart pulled by a Belgian dog. Within the
      cart are the remains of his prosperous past&mdash;a coat, photos of his dead
      wife, and his three sons at the front, and a brass kettle.</p>

      <p>I heard from an aged man how he escaped death. He, with other
      villagers, was locked into a room, and from without the German carbines
      were thrust through the blinds. Those within were told to "dance for
      their lives," and the German bullets picked them off, one by one, from
      the street. He had the presence of mind to fall as though dead, and when
      the house was set on fire crawled out through a window into the cowshed
      and got away.</p>

      <p>Now, these stories are not the worst or the only ones. Nor are these
      300 refugees more than a drop of sand on a beach of the thousands upon
      thousands who are at this moment in like case. They are pouring through
      the country now, dazed with trouble, robbed of all they possess.</p>

      <p>Who can help them, even to work? No one has money. Even those rich
      villa people, Americans, are unable to pay their servants. There is no
      "work" save in the fields garnering crops, for which no wages are paid.
      Their country is a devastated waste, tenanted by the enemy, who spread
      like a tidal wave of destruction in all directions. We take the better
      class into our homes, clothe them and feed them gladly, that we may in a
      minute way repay the debt civilization owes their husbands, sons, and
      fathers. France, too, is invaded, and now thousands more of French are
      homeless and penniless.</p>

      <p>We in this formerly gay, fashionable little town see nothing of the
      pageantry of war&mdash;only its horrors, as trains leave with us hundreds of
      wounded from the front. In their bodies we find dumdum bullets, and we
      hear tales which confirm those of the refugees.</p>

      <p>Will America help them? I, an American woman, could weep for the
      inadequacy of my pen, for I beg your pity, your compassion, and your
      help. Not since the days of Rome's cruelty has civilization been so
      outraged.</p>

      <p>I beg your paper to print this, and to start a subscription for this
      far corner of France, where the tide of war throws its wreckage. The
      Winter is ahead, and with hunger, cold, lack of supplies, and isolation
      will create untold suffering. Paris, too, is now sending refugees from
      its besieged gates. Every corner is already filled, and hundreds pour in
      every day. The garages, best hotels, villas, and caf&eacute;s are already filled
      with "those that suffer for honor's sake." The Croix Rouge does splendid
      work for the wounded soldiers, but who will help these victims of war?
      Fifty cents will buy shoes for a baby's feet. Ten cents will buy ten
      pieces of bread. A dollar will buy a widow a shawl. Who will give?  Deny
      yourselves some little pleasure&mdash;a cigar, a drink of soda water, a
      theatre seat&mdash;and send the price to these starved, beaten people,
      innocent of any crime.</p>

      <p>You American women, who tuck your children into their clean beds at
      night, remember these children, reared as carefully as yours, without
      relatives, money, or future. They will be placed on farms to do a
      peasant's work with peasants. These women bereft of all that was dear
      face a barren future. These aged men anticipate for their only remaining
      blessing death, which will take them from a world which has used them
      ill.</p>

      <p>America is neutral. Let her remain so, but compassion has no
      nationality. We are all children of one Father. Send us help. These poor
      creatures hold out to you pleading hands for succor.</p>

      <h3>A New Russia Meets Germany</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Perceval Gibbon.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[From <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span>, Oct. 26, 1914.]</p>

      <p>VILNA, Russia, Sept. 28.&mdash;For a fact as great as
      Russia one needs a symbol by which to apprehend it For me, till now, the
      symbol has been a memory of Moscow in the Winter of 1905, the Winter of
      revolution, when the barricades were up in the streets and the dragoons
      worked among the crowds like slaughtermen in a shambles. Toward that
      arched gateway leading from the Red Square into the Kremlin came soldiers
      on foot, bringing with them prisoners dredged out of the turmoil, two
      armed men to each battered and terrified captive, whose white and
      bloodstained face stared startling and ghastly between the gray uniform
      greatcoats.  The first of them came to the deep arch, in whose recess is
      a lamplit shrine; I stood aside to see them go past. The soldiers were
      wrenching the man along by the arms, each holding him on one side; I
      recall yet the prisoner's lean, miserable face, with the suggestion it
      had of dissolute and desperate youth; and as they came abreast of the
      faintly gleaming ikon in the gate they let him go for a moment. His dazed
      eyes wandered up to the shrine; he was already bareheaded, and with a
      shaking, uncertain hand he crossed himself in the intricate Russian
      fashion. The soldiers who guarded him, too&mdash;they shuffled their rifles to
      a convenient hold to have a right hand free; they crossed themselves and
      their lips moved. Then they were through the arch and out upon the snow
      within the walls, and once again they had hold of their man and were
      thrusting him along to the prison which for him was the antechamber of
      death.</p>

      <p>That was Russia then. Prisoner and captors, soldiers and
      revolutionaries, blinded and bewildered by the rush and dazzle of
      affairs, straining asunder yet linked, knitted into a unity of the spirit
      which they neither understood nor questioned.</p>

      <p>But a week ago, on those still, dreary lands which border the Prussian
      frontier, there was evidence of a Russia that has been born or made since
      those hectic days in Moscow. The Germans who had forced Gen.  Rennenkampf
      to withdraw to the border were making an attempt to envelop his left
      wing. Their columns, issuing from the maze of lakes and hills in
      Masurenland, came across the border on both banks of the little River
      Amulew, and fell upon him. There is a road in those parts that drifts
      south along the frontier, an unmade, unholy Russian road, ribbed with
      outcrops of stone, a purgatory to travel upon till the snow clothes it
      and one can go by sledge. Away to the southwest, beyond the patches of
      firwood and the gray,
      <ins class="correction" title="[Transcriber: original 'steply']">steeply</ins>
      rolling land, there toned the far diapason of artillery; strings of army
      transport, Red Cross vehicles, and miscellaneous men straggled upon the
      road.</p>

      <p>From beyond the nearest shoulder of land sounded suddenly some
      gigantic and hoarse whistle, an ear-shattering roar of warning and
      urgency. There was shouting and a stir of movement; the wagons and Red
      Cross vans began to pull out to one side; and over the brow of the hill,
      hurtling into sight, huge, unbelievably swift, roaring upon its whistle,
      tore a great, gray-painted motor lorry, packed with khaki-clad
      infantrymen. It was going at a hideous speed, leaping its tons of weight
      insanely from rock ridge to traffic-churned slough in the road; there was
      only time to note its immensity and uproar and the ranked faces of the
      men swaying in their places, and it was by, and another was bounding into
      sight behind it. A hundred and odd of them, each with thirty men on
      board&mdash;three battalions to reinforce the threatened left wing&mdash;a mighty
      instrument of war, mightily wielded. It was Russia as she is today, under
      way and gathering speed.</p>

      <p>At Rennenkampf's headquarters at Wirballen, where formerly one changed
      trains going from Berlin to Petersburg, one sees the fashion in which
      Russia shapes for war. Here, beneath a little bridge with a black and
      white striped sentry box upon it, its muddy banks partitioned with rotten
      planks into goose-pens, runs that feeble stream which separates Russia
      from Germany. Upon its further side, what is left of Eydtkuhnen, the
      Prussian frontier village, looms drearily through its screen of
      willows&mdash;walls smoke-blackened and roofless, crumbling in piles of fallen
      brick across its single street, which was dreary enough at its best. To
      the north and south, and behind to the eastward, are the camps, a city
      full, a country full of men armed and equipped; the mean and ugly village
      thrills to the movement and purpose. On the roof of the schoolhouse there
      lifts itself against the pale Autumn sky the cobweb mast and stays of the
      wireless apparatus, and in the courtyard below and in the shabby street
      in front there is a surge of automobiles, motor cycles, mounted
      orderlies&mdash;all the message-carrying machinery of a staff office. The
      military telephone wires loop across the street, and spray out in a dozen
      directions over the flat and trodden fields; for within the dynamic
      kernel to all this elaborate shell is Rennenkampf, the Prussian-Russian
      who governs the gate of Germany.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Here is the brain of the army. Its limbs go swinging by at all hours,
      in battalions and brigades, or at the trot, with a jingle of bits and
      scabbards, or at the walk, with bump and clank, as the gun wheels clear
      the ruts. It is the infantry&mdash;that fills the eye&mdash;fine, big stuff, man
      for man the biggest infantry in the world.</p>

      <p>Their uniform of peaked cap, trousers tucked into knee-boots, and
      khaki blouse is workmanlike, and the serious middle-aged officers
      trudging beside them are hardly distinguishable from the men. They have
      not yet learned the use of the short, broad-bladed bayonets; theirs are
      of the old three-cornered section type with which the Bulgarians drove
      the Turks to Chataldja; but there is something else that they have
      learned.  Since the first days of the mobilization that brought them from
      their homes there is not a man among them that has tasted strong drink.
      In 1904 the men came drunk from their homes to the centres; one saw them
      about the streets and on the railways and in the gutters. But these men
      have been sober from the start, and will perforce be sober to the
      end.</p>

      <p>Of all that elaborate and copious machinery of war which Russia has
      built up since her failure in Manchuria there is nothing so impressive as
      this. Her thousand and odd aeroplanes, her murderously expert artillery,
      her neat and successful field wireless telegraph, even her strategy,
      count as secondary to it. The chief of her weaknesses in the past has
      been the slowness of her mobilization; Germany, with her plans laid and
      tested for a mobilization in four days, could count on time enough to
      strike before Russia could move. She used her advantage to effect when
      Austria planted the seed of this present war by the annexation of Bosnia
      and Herzegovina; she was able to present Russia in all her unpreparedness
      with the alternatives of war in twenty-four hours or accepting the
      situation. But this time it has been different.</p>

      <p>At Petrograd one sees how different. Hither from the northern and
      eastern Governments come the men who are to swell Rennenkampf's force.
      Their cadres, the skeletons of the battalions of which they are the
      flesh, are waiting for them&mdash;officers, organization, equipment, all is
      ready. The endless trains decant them; they swing in leisurely columns
      through the streets to their depots, motley as a circus&mdash;foresters,
      moujiks in fetid sheepskins, cattlemen, and rivermen, Siberians,
      tow-haired Finns, the wide gamut of the races of Russia, all big or
      biggish, with those impassive, blunt-featured faces that mask the Russian
      soul, and all sober. No need now to make men of them before making
      soldiers; no inferno at the way side-stations and troop trains turning up
      days late. It is as if, at the cost of those annual 780,000,000 rubles,
      Russia had bought the clue to victory.</p>

      <p>West beyond Eydtkuhnen, under the pearl-gray northern sky, lies East
      Prussia. Hereabout it is flat and fertile, with lavish, eye-fatiguing
      levels of cornland stretching away to Insterburg and beyond to
      K&ouml;nigsberg's formidable girdle of forts. Here are many villages, and
      scattered between them innumerable hamlets of only two or three houses,
      and a small town or two. Most of them are empty now; the German army that
      leans its back on the Vistula's fortresses has cleared this country like
      a dancing floor for its work. It has rearranged it as one rearranges the
      furniture in a room; whole populations have been transported, roads
      broken, bridges blown up, strategically unnecessary; villages burned.
      Nothing remains on the ground that has not its purpose assigned&mdash;not even
      the people, and their purpose has been clear for some time past. The
      Russians have been over this ground already, and fell back from it after
      their defeat between Osterode and Allenstein.  Their advance was through
      villages lifeless and deserted and over empty roads; the retreat was
      through a country that swarmed with hostile life.  Roads were blocked
      with farm carts, houses along their route took fire mysteriously,
      signaling their movement and direction, and answered from afar by other
      conflagrations; bridges that had been sound enough before blew up at the
      last moment. What the Belgians were charged with, and their country laid
      waste for, all East Prussia is organized to do daily as an established
      and carefully schooled auxiliary to the army.</p>

      <p>A few days since there arrived a prisoner, driven in on foot by a
      mounted Cossack, sent back by the officer commanding the reconnoissance
      party which had captured him. He came up the street, shuffling at a quick
      walk to keep ahead of the horse and the thin, sinister Cossack&mdash;an
      elderly farmer, in work-stained clothes, with the lean neck and pursed
      jaws of a hard bargainer. In all his bearing and person there was evident
      the man of toilsome life who had prospered a little; in that
      soldier-thronged street, in his posture of a prisoner with the Cossack's
      revolver at his back, he was conspicuous and grotesque. His eyes, under
      the gray pent of his brows, were uneasy, and through all his commonplace
      quality and his show of fortitude there was a gleam of the fear of death
      that made him tragic. He had been found on his farm doing nothing in
      particular; it was out of simply general suspicion that the Russian
      officer had ordered him to be searched. The result was the discovery of a
      typewritten paper, giving precise instructions as to how a German
      civilian in East Prussia must act toward the enemy&mdash;how to signal
      movements of infantry, of cavalry, of artillery; how to estimate the
      numbers of a body of men, and what to say if questioned, and the like&mdash;a
      document conceived and executed with true Prussian exactitude and
      clearness, a masterpiece in the literature of espionage.</p>

      <p>For him there was no hope; even The Hague Convention, which permits
      mine-laying, does not protect spies, however earnestly and dangerously
      they serve their country. He passed, always at the same forced shuffle of
      reluctant feet, toward his judges and his doom.</p>


      <h3>Belgian Cities Germanized</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By Cyril Brown,</b></p>

      <p class="h3">Staff Correspondent of <span class="pscaps">The New York Times</span>.</p>

      <p>BRUSSELS, Nov. 4.&mdash;Of all the war capitals of Europe,
      Brussels under the German occupation is probably the gayest and the most
      deceptive. It certainly outrivals Berlin in life and brilliancy, as
      Berlin outshines London. The Germans are free spenders afield; their
      influx here by thousands has put large sums of money into circulation,
      resulting in a spell of artificial, perhaps superficial, prosperity.</p>

      <p>The crowds surging all day up and down the principal shopping street,
      the Rue Neuve, overflow the sidewalks and fill the street. Well-dressed
      crowds promenade along the circular boulevard all afternoon and into the
      night. Places of amusement and the caf&eacute;s are crowded. The hundreds of
      automobiles loaded with officers speeding about the streets, with musical
      military horns blowing, add to the gay illusion.</p>

      <p>Nowhere save at the Great Headquarters in France, where the Kaiser
      stays when not haranguing his troops at the front, will you see such a
      brilliant galaxy of high officers&mdash;and every day seems a holiday in
      Brussels.</p>

      <p>You catch the sinister undercurrent in the more obscure little caf&eacute;s.
      Here you will find some Belgian patriot who is glad of the chance to
      unbosom himself to a safe American. Perhaps he will speak with
      unprintable bitterness of the shame of the Brussels women who, he says,
      wave handkerchiefs and smile friendly greetings at the singing troop
      trains passing through the suburbs on their way to the front, or give
      flowers and cigars to the returning streams of wounded. They ought to be
      shot as traitresses, he says. For the honor of the Belgian women, he
      adds, these form only a small percentage.</p>

      <p>You are not surprised when well-informed neutral residents tell you
      that these people "have murder in their hearts, and that if the Germans
      ever retreat in a rout through Belgium, Heaven help the straggler and the
      rear guard." Nor that copies of English papers, whose reading is
      forbidden, are nevertheless smuggled in, and that copies of The London
      Times fetch as high as 200 francs, reading circles being often formed at
      20 francs per head.</p>

      <p>But there are no hopeful signs here of a German retreat. Brussels has
      not been "practically evacuated." On the contrary, one gets
      overwhelmingly the impression that the Germans expect to stay forever.
      No cannon are posted on commanding avenues or squares. There are no
      serious measures for the defense of the capital. The military and civil
      Governments occupy the principal public buildings, and seem to be working
      with typical German thoroughness. The Government offices begin to assume
      an air of permanence.</p>

      <p>As conquerors go, the invaders seem to be bearing themselves well.
      There is apparently no desire to "rub it in," the military Government
      seemingly pursuing the wise policy of trying to spare the feelings of the
      natives as much as possible, perhaps in the impossible hope of ultimately
      conciliating them. German flags are flown sparingly. Only small squads of
      Landsturm are now occasionally seen marching through the streets. Even
      from the bitterest Belgians one hears no stories of "insult, shame, or
      wrong."</p>

      <p>At the same time, swift and harsh punishment is meted out to any one
      whose actions are thought to tend to impair German military authority or
      dignity. Thus placards posted on many street corners day before yesterday
      informed the people that a Belgian city policeman had been sentenced to
      five years' imprisonment for "interfering with a German official in the
      discharge of his duty, assaulting a soldier, and attempting to free a
      prisoner." For this, also, a fine of 5,000,000 france ($1,000,000) was
      imposed on the City of Brussels. Another policeman was sentenced to three
      years' imprisonment for alleged similar offenses.</p>

      <p>An interesting history of the German occupation can be reconstructed
      from these same placards pasted on buildings. Here is one, dating from
      the early days, forbidding bicycle riding in the country and announcing
      that civilian cyclists will be shot at sight. If you look long enough you
      can also find a mutilated specimen of ex-Burgomaster Max's famous
      "dementi," in which he virtually calls the German Military Governor of
      Li&eacute;ge and, by implication, the German Government, "liar." The Bruxellois
      must be fickle and quick to forget, for I did not hear the picturesque
      Max's name mentioned once.</p>

      <p>The realities of the military occupation are brought home to the
      people perhaps most at the Gare du Nord and the Place de la Gare, where
      the Civic Guards, in their curious comic opera caps, are reinforced by
      German gendarmes with rifles slung over their shoulders. Civilians are
      not allowed to cross this square in front of the railway station. "Keep
      to the sidewalk" is the brusque order to those who stray. Also the park
      in front of the Royal Palace is closed to the public. Three bright red
      gasoline tank wagons among the trees give it an incongruous touch, while
      the walks and drives are used as an exercising ground for officers'
      mounts. All the windows of the Royal Palace are decorated with the sign
      of the Red Cross.</p>

      <p>Brussels just now is humorously a victim of the double standard&mdash;not
      moral, but financial. All kinds of money go here on the basis of 1 mark
      equaling 1 franc 25 centimes, but shopkeepers still fix prices and
      waiters bring bills in francs, and when payment is tendered in marks you
      generally get change in both&mdash;a proceeding that involves elaborate
      mathematical computations. At the next table to you in the restaurant of
      the Palace Hotel, once a favorite stopping place for Anglo-American
      travelers, but now virtually an exclusive German officers' club, with the
      distinction of a double guard posted at the front door, sits a short,
      fiercely mustached General of some sort&mdash;evidently a person of great
      importance from the commotion his entry caused among all the other
      officers in the room. In his buttonhole he wears the Iron Cross of the
      second class, the Iron Cross of the first class pinned to his breast, and
      underneath the rare "Pour le Merite Order, with Swords." His bill amounts
      to about 7 francs, for he consumed the regular 4-franc table d'h&ocirc;te, plus
      a full bottle of red Burgundy. He tenders a blue 100-mark bill in payment
      and gets in return a baffling heap of change, including 1 and 2 franc
      Belgium paper notes, 5 and 10 mark German bills, Belgian and German
      silver, and Belgian nickel coins with holes punched in the centres. The
      General takes out his pencil and begins elaborate calculations on the
      menu&mdash;then sends for the head waiter. It takes some time and much talk to
      convince him that he is not being "short changed." The double standard
      furnishes many of these humorous interludes.</p>

      <p>Equally exasperating is the double time standard. The Germans set
      their official clocks and watches by Berlin time, but have made no
      attempt to force it on the natives, who continue loyal to Belgian time,
      which is one hour behind Berlin.</p>

      <p>Brand Whitlock, the American Minister to Belgium, who runs a strong
      risk of having a statue erected to him some day by the grateful Belgian
      people, is quite the happiest, most relieved-looking person in Brussels
      since he heard the good news that all America was hard at work collecting
      food for the Belgians and that England would not prevent its delivery.
      Soon after the German occupation of Brussels a committee was organized to
      give food to the poor here, of which Mr. Whitlock and the Spanish
      Minister were patrons. Three weeks ago the Ministerial allies discovered
      that the situation was exceedingly grave, not only here but all over
      Belgium. Committees came to see Mr. Whitlock from Louvain, Li&eacute;ge, Namur,
      Charleroi, Mons, Dinant, &amp;c., and the people, I was told, were within
      four weeks of absolute starvation. Mr. Whitlock got the German Military
      Governor of Belgium, Field Marshal von der Goltz, to give the Spanish
      Minister and himself a guarantee in writing that any food sent in for the
      poor Belgians would not be requisitioned for the German Army.</p>

      <p>The next thing was to get the permission of England; so two weeks ago
      Secretary Gibson was sent to London with Baron Lambert, a banker, and M.
      Franqui to get England's permission as well as a first shipment of food.
      Two weeks ago Mr. Whitlock sent a long letter to the State Department and
      to President Wilson, asking them to do something. At least one phrase of
      Mr. Whitlock's coinage has been going the rounds here. In the various
      preliminary discussions as to whose responsibility it was to take care of
      the Belgian people there was considerable talk about Hague conventions.
      "Starving people can't eat Hague conventions" was his answer.</p>

      <p>Minister Whitlock also feels vastly relieved that he has got
      practically all non-official Americans out of Belgium, the twoscore still
      here being mostly resident business men, with a sprinkling of the boldest
      tourists, who are staying "to see the fun," in spite of Ministerial
      warnings.</p>

      <p>Mr. Whitlock believes he has broken the world's record by being eight
      Ministers at once. At one time he was representing Germany, Austria,
      Great Britain, Japan, Servia, Denmark, and Lichtenstein. When he told a
      German officer that he represented Lichtenstein&mdash;which is said to be a
      small sovereign State somewhere, dependent on Austria&mdash;the officer
      laughed and said: "Theoretically, Germany is still at war with
      Lichtenstein and has been since 1866, it having been overlooked in the
      peace shuffle." The reason for representing Denmark, which isn't at war
      with anybody, is that the Danish Minister is equally accredited to
      Belgium and The Hague, and had no Secretary to leave behind when he
      departed Hagueward. Of course, the American flag does not fly over the
      Danish Legation here. In addition, the French and Russian interests were
      also offered to Mr. Whitlock, but he was so full of responsibility that
      he had to ask to be excused.</p>

      <p>LOUVAIN, Nov. 5.&mdash;Louvain now presents the ghastly
      spectacle of a dead city, buried under ruins, slowly coming to life
      again, and continues to give full scope to the morbid streak in human
      nature; for sightseers continue to flock here in increasing numbers from
      Antwerp, Brussels, and, in fact, all over Belgium, excepting from over
      the deadline of the operating zone. With the Bruxellois especially the
      trip is a favorite outing on a pleasant Sunday. The Germans have
      succeeded in restoring the train service to the extent of two passenger
      trains daily between here and Brussels and one between here and Antwerp,
      and the military authorities pursue a surprisingly liberal policy in
      giving traveling passes to the Belgian population. In addition to those
      who come by train, a steady procession of automobiles passes through all
      day; and next week, when a Berlin-Brussels express service is to be
      started, the local touring season will have a further boom.</p>

      <p>About 5 per cent of the original population have come crawling back,
      and the three companies of Landsturm garrisoned here, together with the
      sightseers, form their source of revenue. The more courageous shopkeepers
      who have come back and reopened their stores are coining money as never
      in peace times&mdash;especially the little confectionery and pastry shops,
      where the soldiers off duty come for afternoon coffee, and the one
      tailor's shop which is open. Workmen are putting the finishing touches to
      the new pine-board roof on the cathedral and are making efforts to
      "restore" the stone exterior. The famous Gothic H&ocirc;tel de Ville is now
      protected by a high board fence, and two bearded Landsturm men mount
      guard there day and night. A gang of laborers is making headway in
      cleaning up the interior of the hopelessly ruined University Library, and
      the streets are all cleared of d&eacute;bris. The academic halls of the main
      university building, which suffered little damage, are not silent, for
      one of the Landsturm companies is quartered there. I found half a hundred
      of them and two cows in the university quadrangle or campus. The men were
      all unshaven, but of a good-natured sort, and many were the rough German
      jokes as they watched a comrade milking the cows preparatory to their
      slaughter on the spot by the company butcher, who stood in waiting, while
      at the same time the gray-haired university castellan was getting ready
      to take a time exposure of the cows.</p>

      <p>"And yet they say we Germans are barbarians," laughed an under
      officer.  "I bet you won't find that the French soldiers, or the highly
      civilized English gentlemen, either, have a photographer come to take a
      picture of the cows they are about to eat."</p>

      <p>The venerable university guardian continued to do a brisk business
      making group pictures and solo portraits of Landsturm under officers and
      men at two francs per dozen postcards, till a Lieutenant appeared on the
      scene and the bugle sounded in the court for "boot inspection." All
      promptly lined up in double file against the brick university wall and
      presented feet for the critical eye of the inspector&mdash;all except the
      company cooks, who were busy among their pots and pans and open-air cook
      stoves set up in the academic stone portico.</p>

      <p>The last of the former students of the University of Louvain was
      probably the well-dressed, meek-looking young Chinese, eating luncheon at
      the near-by restaurant&mdash;the only one open in town. The German soldiers,
      fortunately, did not mistake him for a Japanese, and he has not been
      molested.</p>

      <p>There are touches of grim humor among the ruins. Here on the main
      street, for example, is a pink placard stuck on a stick on top of the
      heap of brick and mortar that was once a store. It reads: "Elegant
      corsets: Removed to Rue Malines 21." And again, on a number of houses
      that escaped the torch are pasted neatly printed little signs bearing the
      legend: "This house is to be protected. Soldiers are not allowed to enter
      houses or to set fire to them without orders from the Kommandantur."</p>

      <p>The inhabitants who have no stores to keep seem continually to wander
      aimlessly in the streets; and here, too, is the sight, common now all
      over Belgium, of many women with children begging. Especially they linger
      around the entrances to the barracks, for hunger has given them a keen
      nose for bread, and they have soon learned that the soldier will give
      them what they have left over from their ample rations. The German
      Government is trying to stimulate the return of the population, and is
      apparently doing its best to help them to earn a living by providing
      work.</p>

      <hr class="minor" />

      <p>ANTWERP, Nov. 6.&mdash;The Germans are working incessantly
      to repair the fortifications of Antwerp, mount new and heavier guns, and
      put the whole place into a state of defense. The importance attached to
      their almost feverish activities is indicated by the fact that Field
      Marshal von der Goltz, the Military Governor of Belgium, ran over from
      Brussels and made a tour of inspection of the double girdle of forts
      yesterday. His Excellency von Frankenberg and Ludwigsdorf, Personal
      Adjutant of the Military Governor of Antwerp, said to me in the course of
      a cordial interview:</p>

      <p>"We have two principal interests in our work here: First, that Antwerp
      shall become a place of great military importance again and be prepared
      against attacks from the enemy, although that contingency doesn't seem
      very probable."</p>

      <p>His Excellency was unwilling to hazard a guess as to how long the
      Germans could hold Antwerp against an allied siege, but said: "I believe
      we could hold out longer against the Allies than they did against the
      Germans. Our second interest is to revive trade and industry and the life
      of the city generally. When we first came here there were only soldiers
      and hungry dogs on the streets; now, as you can see, the dead city is
      coming to life in short order."</p>

      <p>He scouted the idea that the people of Belgium had been or were on the
      brink of starvation as the result of German occupation, saying that the
      very contrary was the case. "Belgium is a country which cannot sustain
      itself&mdash;it produces only enough food for roughly 3,000,000 out of its
      5,000,000 population, because Belgium is an industrial country, and food
      for the remaining 2,000,000 has to be imported. Heretofore most of this
      food has come from Holland, whence some is still coming, but in no great
      quantity. We have taken the problem of food supply up with the Belgian
      Government, as much as there is one left, namely, with the
      municipalities, and at our suggestion an 'Intercommunistic Commission'
      has been organized, so that everything possible can be done to help the
      country. This commission sits in Brussels, and when any town or village
      or district has no more food on hand the fact is reported and it gets
      from the commission what is required. What food supplies we found here we
      took charge of to prevent their being plundered, and also because we, as
      a belligerent, had to supply our own necessities; that is the right of
      war. But by no means have we used up all the food supplies ourselves, nor
      set them aside for our own use; but a large part has been set aside for
      this commission, to be used for the poor, and another part will be given
      back in a short time for trade purposes, so that commerce will be revived
      again.</p>

      <p>"There is no place in Belgium where the people have starved. Their
      most pressing need now would appear to be money, for many are unemployed
      and many others disinclined to work. At one place where we were told the
      people were starving we found stores crammed full of food&mdash;but the
      inhabitants had no money and the shopkeepers wouldn't give them
      credit.</p>

      <p>"Everything is being done by us to revive business so that the people
      can again earn money. If America had not been so tender-hearted as to
      send foodstuffs, and if the food supply had run out, we should certainly
      have considered it our duty to bring food from Germany, for we are for
      the time being the Government here, and it is our duty to see that the
      people do not starve."</p>

      <p>German newspaper readers are not aware that their Kaiser had a narrow
      escape from the bombs of the Allies' airmen at Thielt, for the fact of
      the War Lord's recent invasion of Belgium has been kept as nearly a dead
      secret as possible. I learned from an especially well-informed source in
      Brussels that the object of the Kaiser's visit was not only to encourage
      his troops but to reprove his Generals. According to this informant, who
      is frequently in touch with high officers in their more mellow moods,
      when military reticence somewhat relaxes, the Kaiser was said to be in a
      towering rage at the failure of his army to make headway against the
      English and Belgians on the coast, and to have decided to go in person to
      see about it; also there has been considerable cautiously veiled
      criticism of his persistent "interference" in the conduct of the
      campaign.</p>

      <p>Having last seen the Kaiser two weeks ago motoring at the German Great
      Headquarters in Eastern France, I picked up his trail at Louvain, through
      which place he passed by night a week ago in a special train in the
      direction of Lille, after a scouting pilot engine had returned and
      reported "all safe." On his return journey from Flanders he was rumored
      to have "put up" at the Palais d'Arenberg in Brussels.</p>

      <p>It is significant that the following notice has been placarded on the
      outside of the building occupied by the Military Government, next door to
      the Hotel St. Antoine: "Reports that the French and English are marching
      on Antwerp are without foundation; the public is warned against helping
      to circulate these false reports." All day crowds hang about the door
      where this notice is posted among official German news bulletins.  The
      burghers of Antwerp are well informed about the varying fortunes of the
      war, for several papers printed in French are allowed to appear, under
      the German censorship, which seems surprisingly easygoing here and
      eminently fair, allowing them to print not merely the official German
      accounts circulated by the Wolff Bureau, but the official English,
      French, Russian, and even Belgian bulletins as well, in addition to
      matter copied from the Dutch papers, which are also allowed to circulate
      here.</p>

      <p>If things look doubtful in the north, the Germans are looking
      confidently to the south, where the next big victory is hoped for. I
      learn that Gen. von Beseler, "the conqueror of Antwerp," as his popular
      picture postcard title reads, is now in charge of operations around
      Verdun, and that four of the new 42-centimeter mortars, in addition to
      more than thirty of the 30.5-centimeter, are already in place there. On
      the strength of this combination well-informed German officers
      confidently expect the quick fall of Verdun as soon as Beseler gives the
      order for the "Brummers" to speak&mdash;rather high-priced oratory, for I was
      told by an artillery officer that it cost the taxpayers 36,000 marks
      ($9,000) every time one of the 42-centimeter mortars was fired.</p>


      <h3>The Belgian Ruin</h3>
      <p class="h3"><b>By J.H. Whitehouse, M.P.</b></p>

      <p class="h3">[An Associated Press Interview, Published Oct. 2,
      1914.]</p>

      <p>LONDON, Oct. 1.&mdash;A graphic picture of the desolation
      of Belgium was brought to London today by J.H. Whitehouse, member of
      Parliament from Lanarkshire, who has just returned from a tour around
      Antwerp for the purpose of assisting in the relief measures.</p>

      <p>"Having always regarded war as the negation of all that is good," said
      Mr. Whitehouse tonight, "I desired to see what its ravages were in a
      country exposed to all its fury, and what steps were possible to mitigate
      them. I do not think that any one here has realized the plight of the
      civilian population of Belgium today, and can only attempt to give any
      picture of this by describing some of my own experiences."</p>

      <p>Mr. Whitehouse made the journey outside Antwerp with two military
      cars, attended by Belgian officials. In describing the damage which he
      says the Belgians had to inflict upon themselves to supplement the
      defenses of Antwerp, he said:</p>

      <p>"Hundreds of thousands of trees had been cut down, so that at some
      points of our journey we had the impression of passing through a
      wilderness of roots. The tree trunks had all been removed so as to afford
      no cover to the enemy. All houses had been blown up or otherwise
      destroyed. Later we passed through the country which had been flooded as
      a further measure of defense. The damage resulting from these
      precautionary measures alone amounted to &pound;10,000,000, ($50,000,000.)</p>

      <p>"In the villages all ordinary life was arrested. Women and children
      were standing or sitting dumb and patient by the roadside. Half way to
      Termonde we could plainly hear the booming of guns and saw many evidences
      of the battle which was then raging.</p>

      <p>"I had read newspaper accounts of the destruction of Termonde and had
      seen photographs, but they had not conveyed to my mind any realization of
      the horror of what actually happened. Termonde a few weeks ago was a
      beautiful city of about 16,000 inhabitants&mdash;a city in which the dignity
      of its buildings harmonized with the natural beauty of its situation, a
      city which contained some buildings of surpassing interest.</p>

      <p>"I went through street after street, square after square, and I found
      every house entirely destroyed with all its contents. It was not the
      result of the bombardment; it was systematic destruction. In each house a
      separate bomb had been placed, which had blown up the interior and set
      fire to the contents. All that remained in every case were portions of
      the outer walls, which were still constantly falling, and inside the
      cinders of the contents of the buildings. Not a shred of furniture or
      anything else remained.</p>

      <p>"This sight continued throughout the entire extent of what had been a
      considerable town. It had an indescribable influence upon observers which
      no printed description or even pictorial record could give. This
      influence was increased by the utter silence of the city, broken only by
      the sound of the guns.</p>

      <p>"Of the population I thought that not a soul remained. I was wrong,
      for as we turned into a square where the wreck of what had been one of
      the most beautiful of Gothic churches met my eyes a blind woman and her
      daughter groped among the ruins. They were the sole living creatures in
      the whole town.</p>

      <p>"Shops, factories, churches, and houses of the wealthy&mdash;all were
      similarly destroyed. One qualification only have I to make of this
      statement: Two or perhaps three houses bore the German command in chalk
      that they were not to be burned. These remained standing, but deserted,
      amid the ruins on either side. Where a destroyed house had obviously
      contained articles of value looting had taken place.</p>

      <p>"I inquired what had become of the population. It was a question to
      which no direct reply could be given. They had fled in all directions.
      Some had reached Antwerp, but a greater number were wandering about the
      country, panic-stricken and starving. Many were already dead.</p>

      <p>"What happened at Termonde was similar to what had happened in other
      parts of Belgium under military occupation of Germany. The result is that
      conditions have been set up for the civilian population throughout the
      occupied territory of unexampled misery. Comparatively few refugees have
      reached this country. Others remain wandering about Belgium, flocking
      into other towns and villages, or flying to points a little way across
      the Dutch frontier.</p>

      <p>"Sometimes when a town has been bombarded the Germans have withdrawn
      and the civilians have returned to their homes, only to flee again at the
      renewed attack. A case in point is Malines, which, on Sunday last, as I
      was about to try to reach it, was again bombarded. The inhabitants were
      then unable to leave, as the town was surrounded, but when the
      bombardment ceased there was a great exodus.</p>

      <p>"The whole life of the nation has been arrested. Food supplies which
      would ordinarily reach the civilian population are being taken by the
      German troops for their own support. The peasants and poor are without
      the necessities of life, and conditions of starvation grow more acute
      every day. Even where there is a supply of wheat available the peasants
      are not allowed to use their windmills, owing to the German fear that
      they will send signals to the Belgian Army.</p>

      <p>"We are, therefore, face to face with a fact which has rarely, if
      ever, occurred in the history of the world&mdash;an entire nation is in a
      state of famine, and that within half a day's journey of our own
      shores.</p>

      <p>"The completeness of the destruction in each individual case was
      explained to me later by the Belgian Ministers, who described numerous
      appliances which the German soldiers carried for destroying property.
      Not only were hand bombs of various sizes and descriptions carried, but
      each soldier was supplied with a quantity of small black disks a little
      bigger than a sixpenny piece. I saw some of these disks which had been
      taken from German soldiers on the field of battle. These were described
      to me as composed of compressed benzine. When lighted they burned
      brilliantly for a few minutes, and are sufficient to start whatever fire
      is necessary after the explosion of a bomb.</p>

      <p>"To the conditions of famine and homelessness which exist on such a
      stupendous scale there must be added one which is bad&mdash;the mental panic
      in which many survivors remain. I understood how inevitable this was when
      I saw and heard what they passed through; eyewitnesses of unimpeachable
      character described the sufferings of women and children at Li&eacute;ge. As
      they fled from their burning houses, clinging to their husbands and
      fathers, they were violently pulled from them and saw them shot a few
      yards from them.</p>

      <p>"I should supplement what I have said regarding the condition of
      Belgium with some reference to Antwerp itself, where the excited
      Government now sits. It is a wonderful contrast to the rest of the
      country, and the first impression of the visitor is that there is little
      change between its life now and in the days of peace. I approached it by
      water, and in the early morning it rose before me like a fairy city. Its
      skyline was beautifully broken by the spires and towers of its churches,
      including the incomparable Gothic Cathedral.</p>

      <p>"When I entered its shops were open, its streets crowded, and
      everywhere there was eager activity. By midday the streets became
      congested. Early editions of the papers were eagerly bought and great
      crowds assembled wherever a telegram giving news could be read. This
      continued until early evening, but by 8 o'clock a most extraordinary
      change had fallen upon the city.</p>

      <p>"Not a light of any kind in house or shop was to be seen. No lamps
      were lit in the streets and the city was plunged into absolute darkness.
      Not a soul remained in the streets. To the darkness there was added
      profound silence. It was as though this amazing city had been suddenly
      blotted out."</p>


      <h3>The Wounded Serb</h3>

      <p class="h3">[From The London Times, Oct. 18, 1914.]</p>

      <p class="right">VALIEVO, Sept. 25.</p>

      <p>Valievo lies at the terminus of a narrow-gauge
      railway which joins the Belgrade-Salonika line at Mladinovatz. Along this
      single track of iron road the entire transport of the Servian Army is
      being effected.  Westward come trains packed with food, fodder,
      munitions, and troops; eastward go long convoys crowded with maimed
      humanity. At Mladinovatz all this mass of commissariat and suffering must
      needs be transferred from or to the broad-gauge line. In this situation
      lies not the least of the problems which beset the Servians in their
      struggle with the Austrian invaders.</p>

      <p>Valievo itself is a picturesque little town which in peace time is
      famous as the centre of the Servian prune trade. Its cobbled streets are,
      in the main, spacious and well planned. There still remain a few relics
      of the Turkish occupation&mdash;overhanging eaves, trellised windows, and the
      like&mdash;but these one must needs seek in the by-ways. I picture Valievo
      under normal conditions as one of the most attractive of Balkan
      townships.</p>

      <p>Nor has the tableau lost anything in the framing, for it is encircled
      by a molding of verdant hills which run off into a sweep of seeming
      endless woods. The vista from my hotel window is almost aggravatingly
      English.  Across the red-tiled roofs of intervening cottages rises the
      hillside&mdash;a checkerboard of grassy slopes and patches of woodland
      intersected by a brown road which runs upward until the summit,
      surmounted by a whitewashed shrine, amid a cluster of walnut trees,
      touches the gray sky.</p>

      <p>But Valievo is not now to be seen under normal conditions. From the
      street below rises the sound of clatter and creak as the rude oxen wagons
      bump over the cobblestones. Morning, noon, and night they rumble along
      unceasingly, and whenever I look down I see martial figures clad in
      tattered, muddy, and blood-stained uniforms, with rudely bandaged body or
      head or foot. Every now and then a woman breaks from the crowd of waiting
      loiterers and rushes up to a maimed acquaintance. They exchange but a few
      sentences, and then she turns, buries her head in her apron, and stumbles
      along the street wailing a bitter lament for some husband, brother, or
      son who shall return no more. A friend supports and leads her home; but
      the onlooking soldiers regard the scene with indifference and snap out a
      rude advice "not to make a fuss." They brook no wailing for Serbs who
      have died for Servia.</p>

      <p>The town itself has been transformed into one huge camp of wounded.
      All adaptable buildings&mdash;halls, caf&eacute;s, school-rooms&mdash;have been rapidly
      commandeered for hospitals. Sometimes there are beds, more often rudely
      made straw mattresses, for little Servia, worn out by two hard wars, is
      ill-equipped to resist the onslaught of a great power. For 16 days a
      fierce battle has been raging near the frontier, and wounded have been
      pouring in much more rapidly than accommodation can be found for
      them.</p>

      <p>And in the streets&mdash;what misery! The lame, the halt, the maimed. Men
      with damaged leg or foot hopping along painfully by the aid of a friendly
      baton; men nursing broken arms or shattered hands; men with bandaged
      heads; men being carried from operating shops to caf&eacute; floors; men with
      body wounds lying on stretchers&mdash;all with ragged, blood-bespattered
      remnants of what once were uniforms. One sees little of the glory of war
      in Valievo. The Servian Medical Staff, deprived on this occasion of
      outside assistance, and short alike of doctors, surgeons, nurses, and
      material, is striving heroically to cope with its task. Where they have
      been able to equip hospitals the work has been very creditably done. One
      building is almost exclusively devoted to cases where amputations have
      been necessary. It is clean, orderly, and the patients are obviously well
      cared for. Here, when I entered a ward of some thirty beds in which every
      man lay with a bandaged stump where his leg should be, I think I saw the
      Servian spirit at its best. They had been newly operated upon, their
      sufferings must have been great, and for them all the future is black
      with forebodings. There is no patriotic fund in little Servia. Yet amid
      all the pain of body and uncertainty of mind that must have been theirs
      they did not complain. All they desired to know was whether the Schwaba
      (Austrians) had been beaten out of Servia.</p>

      <p>But it is when one leaves the organized hospitals and wends one's way
      through the crowds of wounded who block the pavements, and enters a
      lower-class caf&eacute;, that the appalling tragedy of it all fills even the
      spectator with a sense of hopelessness. There, like cattle upon their bed
      of straw, lie sufferers from all manner of hurts. They remain mute and
      uncomplaining, just as they have been dropped down from the incoming oxen
      transports. Their wounds&mdash;three, four, or five days old&mdash;have yet
      received no attention save the primitive first-aid of the battlefield.
      Blood poisoning is setting in; limbs that prompt dressing would have
      saved are fast becoming victims for the surgeon's knife. Most of them
      know the risk they run, for this is their third war&mdash;often, too, their
      third wound&mdash;in two short years. Yet the doctors cannot come, because
      every man of them is already doing more than human energy allows. It is a
      heartrending sight to look down upon this helpless mass and to realize
      that many of them have been sentenced to painful death for mere lack of
      primitive medical attention.</p>

      <p>One wonders whether, now that half Europe has been transformed into a
      vast slaughterhouse, appeals for sympathy can be other than in vain.</p>

      <h2>Spy Organization in England</h2>
      <p class="h2">British Home Office Communication, Oct. 9.</p>

      <p>In view of the anxiety naturally felt by the public
      with regard to the system of espionage on which Germany has placed so
      much reliance and to which attention has been directed by recent reports
      from the seat of war, it may be well to state briefly the steps which the
      Home Office, acting on behalf of the Admiralty and War Office, has taken
      to deal with the matter in this country. The secrecy which it has
      hitherto been desirable in the public interest to observe on certain
      points cannot any longer be maintained owing to the evidence which it is
      necessary to produce in cases against spies that are now pending.</p>

      <p>It was clearly ascertained five or six years ago that the Germans were
      making great efforts to establish a system of espionage in this country,
      and in order to trace and thwart these efforts a Special Intelligence
      Department was established by the Admiralty and the War Office which has
      ever since acted in the closest co-operation with the Home Office and
      metropolitan police and the principal provincial police forces. In 1911,
      by the passing of the Official Secrets act, 1911, the law with regard to
      espionage, which had hitherto been confused and defective, was put on a
      clear basis and extended so as to embrace every possible mode of
      obtaining and conveying to the enemy information which might be useful in
      war.</p>

      <p>The Special Intelligence Department, supported by all the means which
      could be placed at its disposal by the Home Secretary, was able in three
      years, from 1911 to 1914, to discover the ramifications of the German
      Secret Service in England. In spite of enormous efforts and lavish
      expenditure of money by the enemy, little valuable information passed
      into their hands. The agents, of whose identity knowledge was obtained by
      the Special Intelligence Department, were watched and shadowed without,
      in general, taking any hostile action or allowing them to know that their
      movements were watched. When, however, any actual step was taken to
      convey plans or documents of importance from this country to Germany, the
      spy was arrested, and in such case evidence sufficient to secure his
      conviction was usually found in his possession. Proceedings under the
      Official Secrets act were taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions,
      and in six cases sentences were passed varying from eighteen months to
      six years' penal servitude. At the same time steps were taken to mark
      down and keep under observation all the agents known to be engaged in
      this traffic, so that when any necessity arose the police might lay hands
      on them at once; and, accordingly, on the 4th of August, before the
      declaration of war, instructions were given by the Home Secretary for the
      arrest of twenty known spies, and all were arrested. This figure does not
      cover a large number&mdash;upward of 200&mdash;who were noted as under suspicion or
      to be kept under special observation.  The great majority of these were
      interned at or soon after the declaration of war.</p>

      <p>None of the men arrested in pursuance of the orders issued on Aug. 4
      has yet been brought to trial, partly because the officers whose evidence
      would have been required were engaged in urgent duties in the early days
      of the war, but mainly because the prosecution by disclosing the means
      adopted to track out the spies and prove their guilt would have hampered
      the Intelligence Department in its further efforts. They were and still
      are held as prisoners under the powers given to the Secretary of State by
      the Aliens Restriction act. One of them, however, who established a claim
      to British nationality, has now been formally charged; and, the reasons
      for delay no longer existing, it is a matter for consideration whether
      the same course should now be taken with regard to some of the other
      known spies.</p>

      <p>Although this action taken on August 4 is believed to have broken up
      the spy organization which had been established before the war, it is
      still necessary to take the most rigorous measures to prevent the
      establishment of any fresh organization and to deal with individual spies
      who might previously have been working in this country outside the
      organization, or who might be sent here under the guise of neutrals after
      the declaration of war. In carrying this out the Home Office and War
      Office have now the assistance of the cable censorship, and also of the
      postal censorship, which, established originally to deal with
      correspondence with Germany and Austria, has been gradually extended (as
      the necessary staff could be obtained) so as to cover communications with
      those neutral countries through which correspondence might readily pass
      to Germany or Austria. The censorship has been extremely effective in
      stopping secret communications by cable or letter with the enemy, but as
      its existence was necessarily known to them it has not, except in a few
      instances, produced materials for the detection of espionage.</p>

      <p>On Aug. 5 the Aliens Restriction act was passed, and within an hour of
      its passing an order in council was made which gave the Home Office and
      the police stringent powers to deal with aliens, and especially enemy
      aliens, who under this act could be stopped from entering or leaving the
      United Kingdom, and were prohibited while residing in this country from
      having in their possession any wireless or signaling apparatus of any
      kind, or any carrier or homing pigeons. Under this order all those
      districts where the Admiralty or War Office considered it undesirable
      that enemy aliens should reside have been cleared by the police of
      Germans and Austrians, with the exception of a few persons, chiefly women
      and children, whose character and antecedents are such that the local
      Chief Constable, in whose discretion the matter is vested by the order,
      considered that all ground for suspicion was precluded. At the same time
      the Post Office, acting under the powers given them by the Wireless
      Telegraphy acts, dismantled all private wireless stations; and they
      established a special system of wireless detection by which any station
      actually used for the transmission of messages from this country could be
      discovered. The police have co-operated successfully in this matter with
      the Post Office.</p>

      <p>New and still more stringent powers for dealing with espionage were
      given by the Defense of the Realm act, which was passed by the Home
      Secretary through the House of Commons and received the Royal Assent on
      Aug. 8. Orders in council have been made under this act which prohibit,
      in the widest possible terms, any attempt on the part either of aliens or
      of British subjects to communicate any information which "is calculated
      to be or might be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy"; and any
      person offending against this prohibition is liable to be tried by
      court-martial and sentenced to penal servitude for life. The effect of
      these orders is to make espionage a military offense. Power is given both
      to the police and to the military authorities to arrest without a warrant
      any person whose behavior is such as to give rise to suspicion, and any
      person so arrested by the police would be handed over to the military
      authorities for trial by court-martial. Only in the event of the military
      authorities holding that there is no prima facie case of espionage or any
      other offense triable by military law is a prisoner handed back to the
      civil authorities to consider whether he should be charged with failing
      to register or with any other offense under the Aliens Restriction
      act.</p>

      <p>The present position is therefore that espionage has been made by
      statute a military offense triable by court-martial. If tried under the
      Defense of the Realm act the maximum punishment is penal servitude for
      life; but if dealt with outside that act as a war crime the punishment of
      death can be inflicted.</p>

      <p>At the present moment one case is pending in which a person charged
      with attempting to convey information to the enemy is now awaiting his
      trial by court-martial; but in no other case has any clear trace been
      discovered of any attempt to convey information to the enemy, and there
      is good reason to believe that the spy organization crushed at the
      outbreak of the war has not been re-established.</p>

      <p>How completely that system had been suppressed in the early days of
      the war is clear from the fact disclosed in a German Army order&mdash;that on
      the 21st of August the German military commanders were still ignorant of
      the dispatch and movements of the British expeditionary force, although
      these had been known for many days to a large number of people in this
      country.</p>

      <p>The fact, however, of this initial success does not prevent the
      possibility of fresh attempts at espionage being made, and there is no
      relaxation in the efforts of the Intelligence Department and of the
      police to watch and detect any attempts in this direction. In carrying
      out their duties the military and police authorities would expect that
      persons having information of cases of suspected espionage would
      communicate the grounds of the suspicion to local military authority or
      to the local police, who are in direct communication with the Special
      Intelligence Department, instead of causing unnecessary public alarm and
      possibly giving warning to the spies by public speeches or letters to the
      press. In cases in which the Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed
      to the authors of such letters and speeches to supply him with the
      evidence upon which their statements were founded in order that he might
      consider the question of prosecuting the offender, no evidence of any
      value has as yet been forthcoming.</p>

      <p>Among other measures which have been taken has been the registration,
      by order of the Secretary of State made under the Defense of the Realm
      act, of all persons keeping carrier or homing pigeons. The importation
      and the conveyance by rail of these birds have been prohibited, and, with
      the valuable assistance of the National Homing Union, a system of
      registration has been extended to the whole of the United Kingdom, and
      measures have been taken which, it is believed, will be effective to
      prevent the possibility of any birds being kept in this country which
      would fly to the Continent.</p>

      <p>Another matter which has engaged the closest attention of the police
      has been the possibility of conspiracies to commit outrage. No trace
      whatever has been discovered of any such conspiracy, and no outrage of
      any sort has yet been committed by any alien&mdash;not even telegraph wires
      having been maliciously cut since the beginning of the war. Nevertheless
      it has been necessary to bear in mind the possibility that such a secret
      conspiracy might exist or might be formed among alien enemies resident in
      this country. Accordingly, immediately after the commencement of
      hostilities, rigorous search was made by the police in the houses of
      Germans and Austrians, in their clubs, and in all places where they were
      likely to resort. In a few cases individuals were found who were in
      possession of a gun or pistol which they had not declared, and in one or
      two cases there were small collections of ancient firearms, and in such
      cases the offenders have been prosecuted and punished; but no store of
      effective arms&mdash;still less any bombs or instruments of destruction&mdash;have
      so far been discovered. From the beginning any Germans or Austrians who
      were deemed by the police to be likely to be dangerous were apprehended,
      handed over to the military authorities, and detained as prisoners of
      war; and, as soon as the military authorities desired it, general action
      was taken to arrest and hand over to military custody Germans of military
      age, subject to exceptions which have properly been made on grounds of
      policy. About 9,000 Germans and Austrians of military age have been so
      arrested and are held as prisoners of war in detention camps, and among
      them are included those who are regarded by the police as likely in any
      possible event to take part in any outbreak of disorder or
      incendiarism.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
